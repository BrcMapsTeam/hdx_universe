{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of IDPs in Bor UNMISS Base and Protection of Civilian (PoC) areas, in Jonglei state, as seen by the WorldView-3 satellite on 8 October 2015. The IDP structures were moved from the old PoC area in the northeast of the base to the new PoC area found in the south, and currently all the IDP shelters are now entirely in the southern extension of the UNMISS base. There are currently 1,077 structures in the IDP settlement with 101 consisting of infrastructure buildings and 976 of shelter structures. A large part of the camp still remains unoccupied and this can be seen as the Contingency area. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR -UNOSAT"}
