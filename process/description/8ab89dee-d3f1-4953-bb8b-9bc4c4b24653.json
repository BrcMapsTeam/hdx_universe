{"notes": "This map illustrates potentially damaged structures and buildings in Southern Dominica as detected by satellite image acquired after landfall of the Tropical Cyclone Maria-17 on 19 September 2017. UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades image acquired on 23 September 2017 as post imagery. Within the extent of this map UNITAR-UNOSAT identified in the cloud free areas of southern Dominica 2482  potentially damaged structures. Taking into account the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, this represent about 80 % of the total number of structures within the analysed area. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
