{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Al Zaatari refugee camp in Mafraq Governorate, Jordan. As of 12 October 2015 a total of 26,963 shelters were detected as well as 2,130 infrastructure and support buildings within the 534.4 hectares of the camp. Between 26 April 2015 and 12 October 2015, a total of 4,310 shelters closed or were moved, and a total of 2,296 shelters were constructed, and the number of shelters has thus decreased by about 2,268 since the previous UNITAR-UNOSAT assessment. This indicates an approximate 7.76% decrease in the number of shelters between 26 April 2015 and 12 October 2015. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field; structure locations subject to a spatial error margin of +/- three meters. Shelters grouped under plastic sheeting were estimated by average household size and may be a source of error. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
