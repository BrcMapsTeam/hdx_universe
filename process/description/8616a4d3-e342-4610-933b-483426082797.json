{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the Northwestern part of Rakhine State in the areas of Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Ponnagyun and Rathedaung Townships of Myanmar as imaged by the Radarsat-2 satellite on 10 July 2015. Heavy rains at the onset of the monsoon season has caused limited flooding, and flood waters seem to have affected roughly 900 hectares of land within the 425 square kilometer analyzed area. The most affected lands seem to be mainly agricultural and/or paddy fields, many of which are of course frequently inundated at other times as well.\u00a0\u00a0This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
