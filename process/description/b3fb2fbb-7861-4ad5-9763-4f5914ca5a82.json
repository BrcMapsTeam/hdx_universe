{"notes": "This assessment was conducted as a follow-up monitoring exercise to the initial shelter and WASH needs assessment conducted in December 2013 and the first shelter and WASH response monitoring assessment in March 2014. The purpose was to understand remaining needs of the affected population, the differing needs of vulnerable groups and outcomes of the shelter sector response. There was a strong focus on assessing the extent to which households were living in safe and adequate dwellings based on shelter recover guidelines developed by the cluster. This information is critical for the humanitarian community and more specifically, the shelter sector, to understand gaps in current assistance, progress in reference to the Strategic Response Plan (SRP) and the extent to which the affected population is ready to move into the recovery phase. \r\nThe assessment was conducted by REACH as part of its partnership with the Global Shelter Cluster. In the Philippines, the shelter cluster is led by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and supported by the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in natural disasters and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in conflict as cluster co-leads."}
