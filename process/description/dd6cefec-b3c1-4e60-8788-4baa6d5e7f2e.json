{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of damage in the town of Bentiu, South Sudan, resulting from ongoing violence in the area. Using an image collected 18 January 2014 by the WorldView-1 satellite, UNOSAT identified almost 1,200 destroyed structures in and around the town. Destruction is largely concentrated along the northern edge of the town along the Bahr al-Gazal river bank and primarily affects homes and related structures as well as some commercial buildings. Using pre-conflict building data UNOSAT estimates that about 8% of the structures in Bentiu are destroyed. This is a preliminary analysis and is based on an enhanced rapid analysis methodology. It has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
