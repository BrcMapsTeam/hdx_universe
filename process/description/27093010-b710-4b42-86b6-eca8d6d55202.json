{"notes": "This map illustrates the satellite-detected water extent in Maguindanao and Cotabato provinces, Phillipines. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Sentinel-1 satellite image acquired on the 07 June 2017 and could observe areas with standing waters mainly affecting agricultural fields. Within the map extent, the UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis identified ~34,000 ha of those areas and ~127 km of potentially affected road mainly local roads. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
