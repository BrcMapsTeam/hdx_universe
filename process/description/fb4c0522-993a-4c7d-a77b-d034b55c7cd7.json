{"notes": "In September  2013, RIWI conducted a study of experiences and perceptions of mental health in the United Kingdom, reaching over 14,000 respondents. Respondents were asked whether they know or interact with someone who suffers from mental illness, and what their perception was of that individual. The data were collected using RIWI's patented Random Domain Intercept Technology\u2122 (RDIT)."}
