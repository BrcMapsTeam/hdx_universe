{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected, potentially damaged structures in the town of Atzala, Atzala Municipality, Puebla State, Mexico. The analysed area is located approximately 7 km west of the mainshock epicentre of the 19 September M 7.1 earthquake. UNITAR-UNOSAT identified 91 potentially damaged structures of which 78 are within the town extent. Taking in account the total 559 pre-event structures in Atzala town, 14% of the structures are likely to be damaged. These analyses was performed using a post-event Pleiades satellite image acquired on 22 September 2017 and a pre-event WorldView-2 satellite image acquired on 11 April 2017. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
