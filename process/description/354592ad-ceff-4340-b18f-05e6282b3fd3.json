{"notes": "In 2014, RIWI Corp. launched an online survey in Nigeria, Liberia, and Sierra Leone capturing public perceptions data from over 4,000 respondents on the status of Ebola in those countries.  Respondents were asked a series of questions related to their confidence in government and aid agencies to manage the Ebola outbreak, as well as their own behavioral response to the infection.  The data was collected using RIWI's patented Random Domain Intercept Technology\u2122 (RDIT)."}
