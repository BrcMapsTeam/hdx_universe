{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Al Zaatari refugee camp in Mafraq Governorate, Jordan. As of 7 January 2014 a total of 28,093 shelters were detected as well as 1,735 infrastructure and support buildings within the 531.8 hectares of the camp. Between 30 September 2013 and 7 January 2014, a total of 4,982 shelters closed or were moved, and a total of 6,868 shelters were constructed, and the number of shelters has thus increased by about 2,171 since the previous UNITAR/UNOSAT assessment. This indicates an approximate 8.4% increase in the number of shelters between 30 September 2013 and 7 January 2014. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field; structure locations subject to a spatial error margin of +/- three meters. Shelters grouped under plastic sheeting were estimated by average household size and may be a source of error. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
