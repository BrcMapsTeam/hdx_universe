{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Minawao refugee settlement, Mayo-Tsanaga District, Far North Province in Cameroon as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite on 19 November 2015. UNOSAT analysed a total of 11,777 structures (9,390 tent shelters, 551 administrative buildings, 634 improvised shelters, and 1,202 semi-permanent shelters) within 502 hectares of the settlement area. Previous analysis from 10 March 2015  indicated 5, 220 shelters over 261 hectares and thus the updated analysis indicates an increase of approximately 126% on shelters and 93% in land occupied. Note that apparently adjoining, contiguous shelters were counted as a single shelter which may  thus underestimate  total number of shelters. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
