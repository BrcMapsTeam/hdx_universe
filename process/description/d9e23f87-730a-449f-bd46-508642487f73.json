{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flooded areas of Kulukh Tapah, Kunduz Province, Afghanistan as seen on WorldView-2 satellite imagery collected 13 May 2014. Heavy rainfall occurred on 23-24 April 2014, causing flooding on the edge of town along the river bank. Approximately 27 structures have been inundated.  It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
