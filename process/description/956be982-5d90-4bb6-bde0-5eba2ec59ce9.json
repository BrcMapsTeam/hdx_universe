{"notes": "The Emergency Tracking (ET) system aims at tracking sudden displacement or return movements triggered by emerging crises. The ET is a crisis-based tool. It does not depend on the location of displacement or return, only on the cause of that movement. The ET figures are not cumulative of the all persons affected by the Mosul crisis thus far, rather the ET update provides only a snapshot of the current displacement situation for the indicated date. The data and information reported on this page are related solely to the displacement caused by the Mosul operations which started on 17 October 2016"}
