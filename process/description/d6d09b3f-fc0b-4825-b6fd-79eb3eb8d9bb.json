{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in Jilah village, Shabwah Governorate, Yemen. Using satellite imagery acquired 5 November 2015 and comparing with imagery collected on 22 August 2015, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified an area severely affected by flash flood resulting from rains during Cyclone Chapala. Imagery shows that the town of Jilah is partially covered by mud and a total of 150 structures appear damaged. Approximately 58 of these were destroyed, 57 severely damaged, and 35 moderately damaged. Primary road N4 is also highly affected by mud as a consequence of the flash floods and it is impassable across several sections. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
