{"notes": "This dataset illustrates satellite-detected potential damaged buildings in Barbuda Island following the landfall of Tropical Cyclone IRMA-17 on September 6, 2017. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades satellite image acquired on 8 September 2017 as post imagery. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis identified 1,071 potentially damaged structures within Codrington town in Barbuda. According to the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian Open Street Map, this represents 89% of potentially affected structures in Codrington town. The analysis could have been underestimated due to cloud cover. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field."}
