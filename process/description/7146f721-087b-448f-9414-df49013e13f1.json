{"notes": "In June 2016, a third round of the MSNA updates was initiated by REACH, supported by ECHO, following the February 2016 update to the MSNA baseline. This assessment draws on community level data, collected from \u201cPeople with Knowledge\u201d (PwK). Findings indicate that the situation of some population groups remains challenging, with prevalent threats to personal safety and security reported in certain locations in addition to unaffordable basic needs, weakened WASH infrastructure, and restricted access to livelihoods and liquidity in some areas."}
