{"notes": "Since May 2013, Nigeria has seen an intensification of conflict due to Boko Haram attacks in its north east states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe. Insurgency and counter-insurgency have inevitably resulted in the displacement of people across the troubled states. In response to the need for accurate information on internally displaced persons (IDPs), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) began implementing the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) project in July 2014. The objective of the project is to support the Government of Nigeria in establishing a comprehensive system to collect and disseminate data on IDPs by strengthening the capacity of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the State Emergency Management Agencies (SEMAs) and other humanitarian actors to conduct assessments on IDPs in a unified and systematized manner. The activities of the DTM project, which consist of conducting baseline assessments and registration for IDPs living in camps and host communities, are currently being carried out in Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe. The information collected will contribute to the provision of a comprehensive profile of the IDP population in Nigeria which will be shared with all relevant stakeholders and will contribute towards enabling the government of Nigeria and humanitarian partners identify the needs of Nigeria\u2019s displaced population and develop interventions for providing IDPs necessary assistance. The project is funded by the Office of Disaster Assistance of the United States Agency for International Development and the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department."}
