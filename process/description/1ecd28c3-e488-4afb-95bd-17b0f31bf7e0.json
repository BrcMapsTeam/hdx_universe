{"notes": "The Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Government of Myanmar) conducted its most recent Population and Housing Census in March/April 2014. The process of preparing census enumeration area maps began in June 2012. Township Immigration Officers who prepared these maps were trained on the objectives of the census, the roles of maps in the census process, concepts of sketching maps at township and ward/village tract level, and plotting new landmark features on the maps. Topographical sheets that make up the entire country were collated and maps of each of the 330 townships printed and distributed to the respective field offices. In total, there were an estimated 81,750 enumeration areas covering almost the entire country.  Some parts of the country could not be mapped due to security reasons.\r\nThe data in this file is drawn from the provisional results as made available in the Population and Housing Census of Myanmar, 2014 \u2013 Provisional Results produced by the Department of Population. This report is the first in a series of publications to be released from the 2014 Myanmar Census.\r\nThe provisional results indicate that the population of Myanmar on the night of 29th March 2014 (Census Night) was 51,419,420 persons. This information will be used as a provisional figure until the main results are released. The main results may be slightly different from the information presented in this first volume of the census results, which is normal in censuses."}
