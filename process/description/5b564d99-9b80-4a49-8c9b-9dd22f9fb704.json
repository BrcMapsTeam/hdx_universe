{"notes": "The dataset is based on the assessments and Health Resources Availability and Mapping (HeRAM) carried out by World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with health cluster partners during different emergencies in Pakistan. Please note that it is not necessary that the assessment covered all the health facilities in a particular district. These have now been provided with a 3 word address so those on the ground can communicate the location of each facility."}
