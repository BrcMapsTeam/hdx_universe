{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected waters over the Shabelle hoose region of Somalia. Using satellite imagery acquired 16 November 2015 and 02 January 2015, UNITAR-UNOSAT identified a total affected area of roughly 2,790 hectares in the Shabelle Hoose province. As of 16 November 2015, approximately 2,970 hectares of probable standing rain waters were detected over the districts of Qoryooley, Kurtunwaarey, Marka, Baraawe and Sablaale. Due to the characteristics of satellite data used for this analysis, the exact limit of flood water is uncertain. Detected water bodies likely reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT. Pre-flood assessment performed by SWALIM."}
