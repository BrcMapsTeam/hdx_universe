{"notes": "This map illustrates potentially damaged structures and buildings in the southeastern part of Dominica (St. Patrick & St. David Parishes) as detected by satellite image acquired after landfall of the Tropical Cyclone Maria-17 on 19 September 2017. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis combined with Copernicus analysis, identified 1304 potentially damaged structures within the extent of this map. Taking into account the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, this represents about 56 % of the total number of structures within the analysed cloud free areas. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
