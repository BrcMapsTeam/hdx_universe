A total of 23,058 ha surface waters were observed. In many zones, the affected lands are mainly agricultural. The analysis of this image reveals also that about 234 km of roads mainly tertiary roads seem to be potentially affected. The population exposure analysis using WorldPop data shows that ~267,000 people are potentially affected by floods within map extent. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT.  \r\n"}
