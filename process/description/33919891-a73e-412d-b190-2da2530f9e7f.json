{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected potentially damaged structures in the area of Puli Khumri, Baghlan Province, Afghanistan. The Puli Khumri area is located approximately 190 kilometers southwest of the 26 October 2015 earthquake epicenter. Using Pleiades satellite imagery acquired 03 November 2015 and WorldView-2 imagery from 01 September 2014, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified 133 potentially damaged structures.  Note that some areas heavily damaged in the south of Qahwakhana appear to have also been affected by a limited landslide. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
