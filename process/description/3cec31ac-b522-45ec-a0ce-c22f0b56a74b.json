{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in western Sagaing Division in the areas of Homalin, Tamu, Phaungbyin and Mawlaik townships of Myanmar as imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellite on 4 September 2015. Waters along the Chindwin have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the river bank and as of 4 September 2015 a total of ~111,000 ha of lands were affected.  Total surface area covered with water in the analysed area has increased from a pre-flood level of 0.4% to 2.9 % during the flood period. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
