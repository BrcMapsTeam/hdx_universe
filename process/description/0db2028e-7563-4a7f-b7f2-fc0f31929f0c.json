{"notes": "This map illustrates areas potentially affected by the mudflow, extracted from a Pleiades and GeoEye-1 satellite images acquired on the 10 April 2017 over Mocoa city and its outskirts, in Putumayo Department, Colombia. Inside some neighbourhoods of the city of Mocoa, flood waters and mudflow have receded compared with previous analysis performed by UNOSAT using an image from 4 April 2017. The situation as of 10 April 2017 reveals: 22 km of roads seem potentially affected and about 1,300 buildings are within areas which are still experiencing floods and mud flow. It is likely that flood waters and mudflow could have been systematically under or overestimated along highly vegetated areas and within built-up urban areas. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
