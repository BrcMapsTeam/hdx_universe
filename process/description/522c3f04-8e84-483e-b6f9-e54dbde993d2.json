{"notes": "This map illustrates shelters in the area of the Hadalat crossing on the Syrian-Jordanian border. Using a satellite image collected by the Deimos-2 satellite on 29 April 2016, UNOSAT located 1,869 probable shelters within the 76.5 ha of the camp. This is a 587% increase in shelters since the previous UNOSAT analysis done using an image collected 29 January 2016. Due to the small size and the irregularity of the shelters it is likely that some shelters may have been missed in this analysis, or some shelters were included erroneously. Due to the scale of this map and the lack of suitable border information at this scale, the border in this map has been excluded. This map is intended for field support and local authorities should be consulted for boundary information. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
