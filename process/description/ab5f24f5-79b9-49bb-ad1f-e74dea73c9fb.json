{"notes": "This map illustrates shelters in the area of the Rukban border crossing on the Syrian-Jordanian border. Using a satellite image collected by the GeoEye-1 satellite on 23 May 2016, UNOSAT located 6,416 probable shelters along the Jordanian side of the border, 25 kilometers southwest of the Al Waleed crossing. This is an 5.1 percent increase in apparent shelters visible compared to the previous UNOSAT analysis done using an image collected 24 April 2016. Due to the small size and the irregularity of the shelters it is likely that some shelters may have been missed in this analysis, or some shelters were included erroneously. Due to the scale of this map and the lack of suitable border information at this scale, the border in this map has been excluded. This map is intended for field support and local authorities should be consulted for boundary information. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
