{"notes": "This map illustrates the satellite-detected water extent in the District of Chittagong, Chittagong Division, in the southeastern part of Bangladesh after the tropical cyclone Mora-17. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Sentinel-1 satellite image acquired on the 30 May 2017 and detected several areas with standing waters. In the district of Chittagong\u00a0~4,790 ha are likely flooded\u00a0and almost 12 km of the local roads seem to be affected. The population exposure analysis using WorldPop data shows that ~70,000 people are potentially affected by floods within map extent. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT.\r\n"}
