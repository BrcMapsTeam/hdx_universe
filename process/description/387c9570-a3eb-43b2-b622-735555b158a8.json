{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of intact and destroyed structures at the Al-Kamoune IDP site, situated near the town of Sarmada in Idlib Governorate, Syria. Using 12 May 2016 and 16 April 2016 satellite imagery collected by the Deimos-2 and Pleiades satellites respectively, UNITAR-UNOSAT identified a total of 1,242 structures. Approximately 1,182 of these structures appeared to be intact and 60 destroyed on 12 May 2016, following an airstrike that hit the site on 05 May 2016. At least two different areas were affected, one of which was covered by sand or gravel as of 12 May 2016. Reconstruction appears to have started a few days prior to this. Due to lower resolution of the 12 May 2016 image there is a higher than usual level of uncertainty in this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
