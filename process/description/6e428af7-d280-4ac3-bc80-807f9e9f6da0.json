{"notes": "The Small Arms Survey tracks statistics on violent deaths and compiles them in its database on violent deaths. Within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), states have pledged to \u2018[p]romote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels\u2019. The first target identified under this goal, Target 16.1, commits all states to \u2018[s]ignificantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere'. The database provides a tool for assessing progress in implementing Target 16.1.\r\n\r\nThe database contains data from 2004 and includes direct conflict deaths and homicide data sets as well data on 'unintentional homicides' and 'legal interventions deaths'. The database served as the backbone of the Global Burden of Armed Violence reports. Data will be updated and shared once a year. "}
