{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected internally displaced persons (IDP) shelters in the area of the Rubkan crossing on the Syrian / Jordanian border. Using a satellite image collected by the WorldView-2 satellite on 25 July 2014, UNOSAT located 90 probable IDP shelters in the open desert and along the border about 25 kilometers southwest of the Al Waleed border crossing. Due to the very small size of the shelters it is likely that some shelters may have been missed in this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT.\n"}
