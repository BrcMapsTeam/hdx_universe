{"notes": "This map illustrates locations of destroyed structures within the arrondissements of Bangui, Central African Republic. Using satellite imagery acquired 16 November 2013, 22 February 2014, and 6 June 2014\u00a0UNOSAT reviewed the city of Bangui to locate signs of destroyed structures. By 22 February 2014, a total of 1,872 structures were destroyed in the area of Bangui, with 1,341 structures detected in the 8 arrondissements and an additional 531 located in the surrounding area. As of 6 June 2014 a total of 368 damaged structures have been reconstructed and 871 additional structures have been severely damaged or destroyed since 22 February 2014. Pre-crisis imagery used for this analysis was collected on 16 November 2013, and thus structures destroyed previous to 16 November 2013 are not indicated on this map. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
