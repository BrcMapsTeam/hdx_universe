{"notes": "This map gives an overview of satellite detected waters near Ha Long City in Quang Ninh Province, northern Vietnam. Due to continuous rain, there is a notable increase in inundated areas north of Ha Long Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the analyzed area, approximately 300 hectares of land have been classified as flood affected, mainly agricultural fields as well as mining areas east of the town of Ha Long. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
