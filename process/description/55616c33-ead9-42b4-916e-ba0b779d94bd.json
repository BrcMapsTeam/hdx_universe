{"notes": "This map illustrates IDPs structure density in the Daynile and Dharkenley districts in Mogadishu, Somalia, as detected in a Pleiades satellite image collected on 9 October 2014. UNOSAT analysis detected a total of 34,806 IDPs structures in these areas, which includes 14,655 temporary housing structures, 213 tukul-style structures, 4,428 shelters and 15,510 buuls. It is likely that subtle differences between temporary housing structures and shelters will lead to significant confusion between those two classes, though the overall structural count is accurate. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT"}
