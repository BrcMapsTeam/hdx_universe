{"notes": "This map illustrates potentially damaged structures and buildings in South Roseau (Saint Georges Parish) as detected by satellite image acquired after landfall of the Tropical Cyclone Maria-17 on 19 September 2017. UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades image acquired on 21 September 2017 as post imagery. UNITAR-UNOSAT identified in the analysed area Roseau South (Castle Comfort, Citronnier and Loubiere) 863 potentially damaged structures. Taking into account the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, this represents about 70 % of the total number of structures within the analysed area. Evidences of floods and mudflow could be also observed in the area of Wallhouse. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
