{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flooded areas of Khwajah Du Koh, Jawzjan Province, Afghanistan as seen on WorldView-2 satellite imagery collected 29 April 2014. Heavy rainfall occurred on 23-24 April 2014, flooding a large part of the town. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
