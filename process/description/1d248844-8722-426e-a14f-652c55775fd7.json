{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of damage in the town of Al Quaryatayn, Homs Governorate, Syria. Using Pleiades satellite imagery acquired 07 May 2016 and 20 August 2010 WorldView-2 imagery as a reference, UNITAR-UNOSAT identified a total of 616 potentially damaged structures. Approximately 79 of these were destroyed, 190 severely damaged, 256 moderately damaged, and 91 possibly damaged. Additionally, a total of 11 impact craters were observed. Due to cloud obstruction, an underestimation of damage is possible. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
