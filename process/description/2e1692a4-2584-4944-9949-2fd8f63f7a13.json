{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of flood affected land as detected in satellite imagery acquired by the TerraSAR-X satellite on 10 August 2014 in Khartoum State, Sudan. The area surrounding Khartoum City was inundated by floods caused by heavy rains. The area to the northeast of Khartoum City is affected by varying levels of water and/or saturated soils. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
