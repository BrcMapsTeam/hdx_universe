{"notes": "The latest IOM Haiti Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) published this week reports a decrease of some 6,400 households or 27,230 people in Haiti\u2019s camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) between January and March 2013.\r\n\r\nThe largest decrease was reported in the commune of Delmas (2,623 households), followed by Port-au-Prince (2,229) and P\u00e9tionville (946), which together accounted for 94% of the decrease in internally displaced households.\r\n\r\nCompared to the height of displacement in 2010, when some 1.5 million Haitians were living in camps following the January 2010 earthquake, the number of IDPs has now shrunk by 79%. But 81,350 households or 320,050 individuals still remain in 385 sites countrywide.\r\n\r\nAbout 60 per cent of the reduction in displaced households in the last three months can be directly linked to the government\u2019s rental subsidy programs, carried out by various partner agencies, including IOM.\r\n\r\nOf the families remaining in camps as of March 2013, 14,430 families (17.7%) are being lined up to join the rental subsidy support program.\r\n\r\nBut almost 67,000 households still have no prospect of moving out of the IDP sites, and 21,600 of them are at risk of being evicted. Since January 2010, evictions have accounted for 6% of the overall decrease in IDP households.\r\n\r\nAccording to the DTM, most of the 385 IDP sites that remain consist of precarious, makeshift structures that leave residents extremely vulnerable, particularly during the hurricane season. Some 86 per cent of the sites have no transitional shelters (T-Shelters); about 11 per cent have mixed structures that include tents, makeshift shelters and some T-Shelters."}
