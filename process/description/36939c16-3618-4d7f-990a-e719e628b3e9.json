{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters south of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, as imaged by the Radarsat-2 satellite on 9 August 2015. Most of the flood affected lands are agricultural fields in the Yangon river delta. There is no significant overflowing of waters along the river bank. In the area analyzed, ~45,000 hectares of land has been identified as flood affected/inundated land as of 9 August 2015. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas near the main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT.\n"}
