{"notes": "#The Challenge\r\nThe amount of water point data is increasing as more governments and development partners begin to monitor water points over time. Unfortunately this progress has been accompanied by increasingly numerous unique methods through which data is collected, stored and shared. As a result, new data is creating new \u201cdata islands.\u201d These emerging monitoring efforts will have limited impact on improving programming and sustainability if the data remains inaccessible on organizational servers, in PDF reports and in proprietary monitoring systems. Without harmonization among these different data sources, the opportunity for learning will be limited, with the true potential of this information remaining untapped.\r\n\r\n#The Opportunity\r\nBy establishing a platform for sharing water point data throughout the global water sector, WPDx will add value to the data already being collected. Through bringing together diverse data sets, the water sector can establish an unprecedented understanding of water services. Sharing this data has the potential to improve water access for millions of people as a result of better information available to governments, service providers, researchers, NGOs, and others. \r\n"}
