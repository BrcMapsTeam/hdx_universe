{"notes": "This is a simplified (generalized or smoothed) version of the detailed Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB) dataset. This dataset included simplified LSIB polygons for Africa & the Americas. Another dataset covers Eurasia & Oceania. This dataset also matches the simplified LSIB lines.\r\n\r\nThe simplified boundary lines reflect all current US government policies on boundaries, boundary disputes, and sovereignty. This dataset excludes medium and smaller islands. These islands, plus two and three-digit ISO codes, can be found in the full resolution LSIB polygon dataset. These files utilize the World Vector Shoreline (WVS) coastline data from NGA. WVS is outdated and often shifted by several hundred meters to over a km.\r\n\r\nThere are no restrictions on use of this public domain data. This dataset will be updated as needed and is current as of March 30, 2017."}
