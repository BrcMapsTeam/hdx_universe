{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of destruction in the majority of Taiz, Yemen, as seen by the WorldView-3 satellite on 26 June 2015. UNOSAT identified a total of 328 damaged buildings (54 destroyed,\u00a066 severely damaged, 156 moderately damaged, 52 possibly damaged) as well as 410 areas with significant amounts of debris. A total of 11 health centers are possibly damaged as they are within 100 meters of other destroyed or damaged buildings. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Note that satellite imagery analysis will not capture all damage to buildings and instead only detects significant or catastrophic amounts of structural damage. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
