{"notes": "Afrobarometer is a pan-African, non-partisan research network that conducts public attitude surveys on democracy, governance, economic conditions, and related issues across more than 30 countries in Africa. Five rounds of surveys were conducted between 1999 and 2013, and results from Round 6 surveys (2014/2015) are currently being released. Afrobarometer conducts face-to-face interviews in the language of the respondent\u2019s choice with nationally representative samples, which yield country-level results with a margin of sampling error of +/-2% (for a sample of 2,400) or +/-3% (for a sample of 1,200) at a 95% confidence level. Round 6 interviews with more than 52,700 citizens represent the views of more than three-fourths of the continent\u2019s population.\r\n\r\nThis policy paper draws mainly on Round 6 data from more than 52,700 interviews in 35 countries, with over-time comparisons for 33 countries that were surveyed in both Round 5 and Round 6, as well as longer comparisons for 20 countries that have been tracked in at least three surveys (see the appendix for a list of countries and survey dates).
