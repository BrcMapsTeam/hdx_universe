{"notes": "The Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index (ONI) has become the de facto standard that the National\r\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses to identify El Ni\u00f1o (warm) and\r\nLa Ni\u00f1a (cool) events in the tropical Pacific. It is the three month mean SST\r\nanomaly for the El Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region (i.e., 5\u00b0N-5\u00b0S, 120\u00b0-170\u00b0W). Events are defined as five\r\nconsecutive overlapping three month periods at or above the +0.5\u00b0C anomaly for warm (El\r\nNi\u00f1o), events and at or below the -0.5 anomaly for cold (La Ni\u00f1a) events. The threshold\r\nis further broken down into Weak (with a 0.5 to 0.9 SST anomaly), Moderate (1.0 to 1.4)\r\nand Strong (\u2265 1.5) events. For an event to be categorized as weak, moderate or strong. it\r\nmust have equalled or exceeded the threshold for at least three consecutive overlapping\r\nthree month periods."}
