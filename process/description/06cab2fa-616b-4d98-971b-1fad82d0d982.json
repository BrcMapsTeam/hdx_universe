Areas that were in preparation of the ground for new construction as 21 July 2013, as 25 December 2013 contain a total of 584 new shelters (estimated). New expansion areas are also visible in the image as of 25 December 2013, indicating preparations are underway to accommodate increased numbers of refugees in the near future. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field; structure locations subject to a spatial error margin of +/- three meters. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
