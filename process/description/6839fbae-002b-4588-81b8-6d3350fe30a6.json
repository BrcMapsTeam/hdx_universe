{"notes": "Shapefiles for the August, 2016 Latin America and Caribbean FEWS NET Food Security Outlook Updates. It was last updated on September 9, 2016. The classification scale used is the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) V2.0, the IPC scale is a widely accepted, standard, five level scale for classifying the severity of food emergencies. The two shapefiles represent the two four month analysis periods:\r\nLAC201606_ML1\tMost likely food security outcome for June - September 2016\r\nLAC201606_ML2\tMost likely food security outcome for October 2016 \u2013 January 2017\r\nWithin the shapefiles, the ML1/ML2 fields contain the IPC area phase classification for the outlook period. The five phases are: \r\n1: Minimal\r\n2: Stressed\r\n3: Crisis\r\n4: Emergency\r\n5: Famine\r\n\r\nAlso, three additional codes may be included in the ML1/ML2 columns:\r\n\r\n66 = water\r\n88 = parks, forests, reserves\r\n99 = No Data/Missing Data\r\n\r\nThe HA1 and HA2 columns indicate if humanitarian assistance is helping to lower the phase classification. If HA1/HA2 = 1, then the phase classification would likely be at least one phase worse without current or programmed humanitarian assistance. In FEWS NET and IPC maps, this is represented by an exclamation mark (!).\r\n\r\nThe IPC_Legend.lyr file is provided for reference. It contains the official IPC color scheme, it also includes the exclamation mark symbology.\r\n[More information](https://www.fews.net/shapefiles)\r\n\r\n"}
