{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters for displaced persons in the Galkayo settlement in Somalia. Using a WorlView-1 image collected on 25 February 2014, UNOSAT located and marked 453 temporary shelter structures in the camp. In addition, 1,799 metal shelter structures were identified which are also likely housing for displaced persons. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
