Using satellite imagery collected 14 August 2014 and 27-28 August 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT analysis has identified 1 destroyed structure, 12 severely damaged structures and 51 moderately damaged structures from a total of 413 schools in the Gaza Strip. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
