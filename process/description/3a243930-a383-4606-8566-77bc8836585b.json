{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Minkaman IDP site in Lake State, South Sudan, as seen by WorldView-1 satellite on 8 February and 12 February 2015. UNOSAT analyzed these images and located 12,349 shelters and 611 administrative buildings in the IDP site area. A previous UNOSAT analysis using an image from 24 November 2014 indicated 18,636 IDPs shelters, and thus the updated analysis represents a decrease of approximatively 33% in the number of shelters. Note that IDPs sheltering under trees are not detected by this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
