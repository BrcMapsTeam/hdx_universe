{"notes": "Summary: A total of 324 spatially distinct IDP shelter concentrations were identified as of 24 November 2013 within Mogadishu, representing a decrease of 56 IDP sites since the last UNOSAT analysis which used an image from 13 June 2013. An estimate of the total number of IDP structures located in Mogadishu indicates a minimum figure of at least 55,000 mostly informal shelters. The number of IDP camps has significantly reduced in multiple areas of Mogadishu. This report is the sixth in a series of IDP analyses done by UNOSAT since 2011 and is based on a time-series analysis of shelter concentrations within the city of Mogadishu using multiple satellite images acquired between 30 March 2011 and 24 November 2013. This assessment has not yet been validated in the field. Please send feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
