{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected waters around the Khartoum City in Sudan as detected in satellite imagery acquired by the TerraSAR-X satellite on 11 August 2016 in Khartoum State. UNOSAT analysis shows an expansion of water of~ 90Km2 (over the analysed area) particularly located in the left bank of White Nile without causing floods inside build up areas. The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Detected water bodies likely reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
