{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected IDP shelters and administrative buildings in M'Poko Airport in Bangui, Central African Republic using satellite images acquired on the 20 January, 22 February and 6 June 2014. As of 22 February 2014 approximately 7,789 structures were detected. Imagery from 6 June shows an important decrease in the number of tent shelters present inside of the airport since an extensive area has been significantly cleared of shelters. As of 6 June UNOSAT detected a total of approximately 3193 tent shelters and 61 administrative support and other structures. Compared to previous UNOSAT analysis the number of shelters has decreased by 58.7%. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
