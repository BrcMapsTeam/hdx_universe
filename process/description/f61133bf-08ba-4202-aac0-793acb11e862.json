{"notes": "This data illustrates shelters in the area of the Hadalat crossing on the Syrian-Jordanian border. Using a satellite image collected by the Deimos-2 satellite on 13 July 2016, UNOSAT located 2,132 probable shelters. This is a 9% increase in shelters since the previous UNOSAT analysis done using an image collected 14 May 2016. Due to the small size and the irregularity of the shelters it is likely that some shelters may have been missed in this analysis, or some shelters were included erroneously. "}
