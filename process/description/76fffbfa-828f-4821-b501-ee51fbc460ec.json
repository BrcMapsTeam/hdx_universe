{"notes": "The **Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM)** is an information management tool and IOM strives to inform all stakeholders on the whereabouts and the situation of the displaced population from the current crisis currently engulfing Iraq. The DTM provides critical tracking and monitoring information of displacement on as regular basis as the prevailing situation allows and to as wider an audience as possible. \r\n\r\nIOM uses a series of methods to regularly collect data on IDPs, making collections nearly every other week. The datasets in this repository span from **March** to **September 2014**.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit [IOM Iraq's DTM website](http://iomiraq.net/dtm-page)."}
