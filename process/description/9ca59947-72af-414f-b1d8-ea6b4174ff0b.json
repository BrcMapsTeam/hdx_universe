{"notes": "This map illustrates the satellite-detected surface waters extent and evolution over Oponono Lake; a large wetland fed by the Culevai Oshana, in Oshana region, Namibia, as observed from the Sentinel-1 images acquired on 02 and 14 March 2017. An increase of surface water extent was detected in the 14 March 2017 image, particularly in the upstream part of the lake: ~4,130 ha of surface water were observed the 02 March 2017 within the lake area and reached ~10,820 ha the 14 March 2017 corresponding to an evolution of about 160%. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
