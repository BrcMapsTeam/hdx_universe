{"notes": "The subnational INFORM model for Caucasus and Central Asia was initiated by the Regional Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Task Force for Caucasus and Central Asia and is managed by OCHA. The INFORM model is being used to support coordinated preparedness actions. Partners hope to use the model to improve cooperation between humanitarian and development actors in managing risk and building resilience across the region.\r\n\r\nINFORM identifies areas at a high risk of humanitarian crisis that are more likely to require international assistance. The INFORM model is based on risk concepts published in scientific literature and envisages three dimensions of risk: Hazards & Exposure, Vulnerability and Lack of Coping Capacity. The INFORM model is split into different levels to provide a quick overview of the underlying factors leading to humanitarian risk.\r\n\r\nThe regional subnational INFORM model for Caucasus and Central Asia is developed at the first administrative level (corresponding to the provinces/oblasts/regions and few independent cities) of the eight countries in South Caucasus and Central Asia.\r\n\r\nThe INFORM index supports a proactive crisis management framework. It will be helpful for an objective allocation of resources for disaster management as well as for coordinated actions focused on anticipating, mitigating, and preparing for humanitarian emergencies."}
