{"notes": "This map illustrates probable IDP shelters in Kismayo, Somalia as seen in satellite imagery collected by the WorldView-1 satellite on 3 May 2014. In this area UNOSAT located 2,952 shelters in 64 apparent IDP settlements. However, poor image quality, density of shelters, and varied construction material introduces significant uncertainty into this analysis. The IDP settlement areas were also compared to an image from 05 March 2014 collected by the WorldView-1 satellite to give indications on whether settlements were new, had closed, or were increasing or decreasing in size. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
