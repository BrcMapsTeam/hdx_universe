{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the Beit Hanun area, Gaza Strip, resulting from ongoing violence in the area. Using a satellite image collected 25 July 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT analysis has identified 214 destroyed structures, 122 severely damaged structures, and 103 moderately damaged structures. In addition, 32 craters on roads and in agricultural and non-urbanized areas are also visible as of 25 July 2014. Note that a certain portion of the image analyzed by UNOSAT was downsampled, so the confidence level for the analysis in this area is \"uncertain\" (103 structures). This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT.\n"}
