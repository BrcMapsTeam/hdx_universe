{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of flood water as observed in Sentinel-1 imagery collected 24 November 2014 and 18 December 2014. Waters extended along coastal areas and shores of inland lakes, with few large bodies of flood waters detected. Numerous roads and railroads are likely inundated by flood waters which may impede transport in those areas. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated in highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
