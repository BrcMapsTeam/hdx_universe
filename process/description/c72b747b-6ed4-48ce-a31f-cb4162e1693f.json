{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of IDPs in the base for the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) at Juba airport as seen by the WorldView-2 and Pleiades satellites on 7 January 2014, 28 December 2013 and 20 December 2013. As of 20 December a significant part of the airport was already used by IDP shelters, occupying a total area of 2.8 ha. By 28 December a very dramatic increase in the number of IDPs is detected in the imagery, occupying more than 7 ha. Imagery from 7 January shows that the expansion of IDPs has been more moderate, observing a total area of IDPs of 7.9 ha. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
