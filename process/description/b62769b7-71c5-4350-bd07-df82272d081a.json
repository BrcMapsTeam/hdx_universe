{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected possible flood water & saturated soil over Khartoum City in Suda nextracted from SPOT-7 imagery on 15 August 2016 in Khartoum State. UNOSAT analysis shows, an expansion of possible flood water and saturated soil over areas particulary located on right bank of the Blue Nile and White Nile, without causing floods inside build up areas. Detected water bodies likely reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
