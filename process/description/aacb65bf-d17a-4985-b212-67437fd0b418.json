{"notes": "The map considers five hazards (flood, earthquake, tsunami, storm surge, wind/storm) in a quantitative way (probability and severity) and two hazards in a qualitative way (landslide, ground rupture). The data were calaculated by utilizing many different data sources for the hazards and vulnerabilities of normal, strong residential buildings. The risk of annual damages, expressed in percent of the value of the building, was calculated by adding the risks of five hazards. The final map shows that the danger of damage is between approximately 1 and 5% for most areas in Leyte Island, Philippines.\r\nA full documentation of the metadata of the map may be downloaded from:\r\nhttp://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/residential-building-suitability-map-leyte-island-philippines"}
