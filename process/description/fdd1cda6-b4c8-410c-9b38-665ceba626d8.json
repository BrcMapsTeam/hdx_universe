{"notes": "This dataset has been added to HDX from the Cash Atlas. The  Cash Atlas is an interactive global mapping tool aiming to visually represent cash transfer programmes at a global level. It is envisioned to be an advocacy and learning tool.\r\nBy demonstrating the use and utility of CTPs across different sectors and contexts, the Cash Atlas provides a tool that can be used in advocacy to promote consideration and appropriate use of CTP in humanitarian response. It also aims to be a learning tool for organisations willing to share their experiences.\r\n\r\nThis project has been developed by CaLP and supported by American Red Cross, ECHO and USAID/OFDA"}
