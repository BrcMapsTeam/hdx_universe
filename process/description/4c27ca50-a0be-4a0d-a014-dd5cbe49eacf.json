The population figures are disaggregated by governorate and district levels, both containing p-codes. The data is further disaggregated by sex and age groups. Additional information on population figures that take into account internally displaced people and returnees in Yemen can be found here [https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/yemen/protection] and is produced regularly by the Task Force on Population Movement."}
