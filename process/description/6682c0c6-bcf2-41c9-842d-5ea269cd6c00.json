{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in central Gaza City, Gaza Strip, resulting from ongoing violence in the area. Using a satellite image collected 25 July 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT analysis has identified 133 destroyed structures, 179 severely damaged structures, and 218 moderately damaged structures. In addition, 126 craters on roads and in agricultural and non-urbanized areas are also visible as of 25 July 2014. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
