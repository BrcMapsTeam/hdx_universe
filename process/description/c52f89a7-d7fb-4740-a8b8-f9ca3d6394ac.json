{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected water extent as of 10 March 2017 over Antsahanoro commune, Antalaha district in Madagascar as detected by TerraSAR-X. As of 10 March 2017, ~ 335 Ha of land over Antsahanoro commune seem to be inundated and have experienced an increase of standing waters. These zones are mainly agricultural and/or swamps in the commune of Antsahanoro. These waters seem to be the results of the recent heavy rain related also to the cyclone ENAWO-17 which made landfall the 07 March 2017. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR UNOSAT.\r\n\r\n"}
