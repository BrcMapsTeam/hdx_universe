{"notes": "This map illustrates the location of damaged structures in the cities of Tadmur and Al-Amiriyah in the Syrian Arab Republic. Using satellite imagery acquired 30 March 2016, 18 October 2015, 27 August 2015, and 26 June 2015, UNITAR-UNOSAT identified a total of 611 damaged structures. Of these, 29 were destroyed, 103 severely damaged, and 479 moderately damaged. Additionally, a total of 66 craters were identified in the same area, an indicator of the level of fighting in these cities. Note that due to the nature of the combat and imagery quality it is likely that some minor and moderate damage has not been detected. UNITAR-UNOSAT will update this analysis as new imagery becomes available. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field.  Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
