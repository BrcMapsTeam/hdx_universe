{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Minkaman IDP site in Lakes State, South Sudan, as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite. As of 13 January 2016, UNOSAT analyses located a total of 17,216 structures which include 713 administrative buildings, 1,538 improvised shelters, 490 permanent structures, 1,438 semi-permanent structures, and 13,037 tent shelters. Previous analysis from 12 February 2015 indicated 12,960 shelters and thus the updated analyses indicates an increase of approximately 33.6% in the number of shelters. Note that IDPs sheltering under trees are not detected by this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT.   \n"}
