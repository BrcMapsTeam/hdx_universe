{"notes": "ACLED makes its dataset of disaggregated conflict and protest data publicly available. A new version of the dataset is released annually, with data from the previous year and targeted quality review being added in each new version. Files for all countries are composed of ACLED events which indicate the day, actors, type of activity, location, fatalities, sources and notes for individual politically violent events. Please see the [codebook](http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ACLED_Codebook_2017.pdf) for further details on conflict categories, actors, events and sources. The [user guide](http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ACLED_User-Guide_2017.pdf) provides guidance on downloading and reading files.\r\n\r\nACLED data are presented in three forms: the first is an Excel for the entire African continent; the second is a corresponding shapefile of the African continent created from those data; the third format is an Excel file called \u201cCOUNTRY X\u201d containing data disaggregated by country which occur in the named state\u2019s territory (including foreign groups active in a state\u2019s territory).
