{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Al Zaatari refugee camp in Mafraq Governorate, Jordan. As of 30 June 2016 a total of 25,815 shelters were detected as well as 1,879 infrastructure and support buildings within the 534 hectares of the camp. Between 12 October 2015 and 30 June 2016 a total of 2,568 shelters were constructed, with even more removed, indicating an approximate 4.26% decrease in the number of shelters between 12 October 2015 and 30 June 2016. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field; structure locations subject to a spatial error margin of +/- three meters. Shelters grouped under plastic sheeting were estimated by average household size and may be a source of error. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
