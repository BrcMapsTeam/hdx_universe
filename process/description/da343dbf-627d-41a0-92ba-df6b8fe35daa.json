{"notes": "This dataset contains detailed Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) data for 110 countries.The Global MPI reflects the combined simultaneous disadvantages poor people experience across different areas of their lives, including education, health and living standards. If people are deprived in at least one-third of ten weighted indicators, they are identified as multi-dimensionally poor. For further information on the MPI visit: http://www.ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/\r\n\r\nThe dataset includes main MPI results for each country, the proportion of people who are MPI poor and experience deprivations in each indicator of poverty, the percentage contribution of deprivations to the MPI for each country, and other measures of poverty and wellbeing at the national level. It is an appendix to OPHI's Methodological Note \u2013 Winter 2014/2015 (http://www.ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/mpi-2014-2015/mpi-methodology/) \r\n\r\nPlease cite the data as: Alkire, S., Conconi, A., Robles, G. and Seth, S.
