{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected water bodies and inundated areas near Khwajah Du Koh, Jawzjan Province, Afghanistan as seen on WorldView-2 satellite imagery collected 29 April 2014. Heavy rainfall occurred on 23-24 April 2014, flooding a large part of the town. UNOSAT extracted a Water Index from the satellite image to determine areas of standing water as well as soils with varying levels of water content (ie, mud). It is likely that flood waters and inundation have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
