{"notes": "This data shows the location and number of teams assigned to complete safe and dignified burials, a key pillar of the Ebola Response Roadmap. Note that in some cases there may be teams reported available at a national level (i.e. \"Liberia has 73 teams available\") but as they are not known to be tied to a specific district they may not be reflected in this dataset. Refer to the latest WHO situation reports for additional context: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/ "}
