{"notes": "This map illustrates the refugee camp currently under construction in Al Azraq, Jordan using an image collected by the WorldView-2 satellite on 26 April 2014. As of 26 April 2014 a total of 7,333 structures were detected in the camp, 2,494 infrastructure and support buildings and 4,839 shelter structures. Nowadays the capacity of the camp is approximately of 12,500 refugees. Preparations are continuing so as to accommodate additional incoming refugees. The previous analysis done by UNOSAT using an image from 28 December 2013 detected a total of 3,174 infrastructure, support buildings and shelters structures. This is an increase of approximately 230%. Paved and unpaved roads have likewise increased significantly and define the transportation network in and around the camp. Water and sanitation services are also under development in multiple camp zones suitable for supporting thousands of proximate shelters. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
