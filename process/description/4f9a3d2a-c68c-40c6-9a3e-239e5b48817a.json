{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damaged and potentially damaged buildings and the related density of damage in the areas north of Sarpol-e-Zahab county in Kermanshah province, Iran following the M 7.3 earthquake that struck the area on the 12 November 2017. The analysis was carried out comparing a post-event Pleiades image acquired on the 16 November 2017 with a pre-event WorldView3 image of 24 July 2017. The results indicate damage across several localities and villages in this zone and about 3300 structures were identified as potentially damaged (e.g. 362 in Koeeke Hasan; 148 in Tapamaran and 98 in Jaberi).\u00a0This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT.\r\n\r\n"}
