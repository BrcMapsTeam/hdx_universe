{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in Gaza Strip, resulting from recent violence in the area. Using a satellite image collected 27 & 28 August 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT analysis has identified 6,769 destroyed structures, 3,565 severely damaged structures, and 4,938 moderately damaged structures in the analysed area. In addition, 7,473 craters on roads and in agricultural and non-urbanized areas are also visible in the crisis images. Note that a few areas along the border with Israeli were analysed in less detail as imagery was downsampled. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
