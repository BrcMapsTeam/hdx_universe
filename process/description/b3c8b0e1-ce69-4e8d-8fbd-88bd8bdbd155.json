{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage in Old City, Mosul, Ninawa Governorate, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 11 June 2017, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 2,589 affected structures within this part of city. Approximately 153 (6% of the total affected buildings) of these were destroyed, 950 (37% of the total affected buildings) severely damaged and 1,486 (57% of the total affected buildings) moderately damaged. The most heavily impacted location appears to be the Bazaar area (see inset). Due to the densely constructed nature of this part of the city, these values might be underestimated. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
