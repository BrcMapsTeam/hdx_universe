{"notes": "This map illustrates the camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the UNMISS base at Juba airport as seen by the WorldView-1, Pleiades and WorldView-2 satellites on 19 January 2014, 7 January 2014 and 28 December 2013. As of 28 December a significant portion of the airport is used by IDP?s shelters, occupying approximately 7 ha. Since then the camp extent has moderately increased its area. Imagery acquired on 19 January 2014 shows that the total area of IDP?s occupies 8.9 ha, compared to the 7.9 ha detected on 7 January 2014. Note that IDP occupied areas include improvised shelters and, in some cases, administrative support and other structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
