{"notes": "This map illustrates the satellite-detected surface waters extent and evolution over Niamey and surroundings in Niger as observed from the Sentinel-1 images acquired on 14 and 26 August 2017. Within the analysed area, an increase of surface waters extent was observed from the 26 August 2017 image: ~7,870 ha of surface water were observed the 14 August 2017 and reached ~10,210 ha the 26 August 2017. All over the analysed zone, it corresponds to an evolution of about 30%. In Niamey an increase of water surface of 320 ha was observed corresponding to an evolution of ~20% by comparison to the surface water detected on 14 August 2017. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
