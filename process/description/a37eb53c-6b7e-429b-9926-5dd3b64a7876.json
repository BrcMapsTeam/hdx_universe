{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected destroyed or otherwise damaged structures in Maungdaw and Buthindaung townships, Maungdaw District, Myanmar. The analysis found a total area of more than 160  thousand square meters of destroyed structures occurring between 25 September and 1 October 2017. This represents an increase of approximately 1% since last UNOSAT analysis with imagery collected on 25 September, when more than 20.5 square kilometers of destroyed structures were identified. Additionally, 6 fires were detected within the area between 25 September and 1 October 2017 by the MODIS and VIIRS sensors, with recent fire detections indicating destruction is likely ongoing. Most of the detected fires are located in the proximity of the affected areas as observed in the imagery collected 1 October. Finally, heavy cloud cover and haze during the period in question, indicates that destruction and fire detections are likely underestimated in this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
