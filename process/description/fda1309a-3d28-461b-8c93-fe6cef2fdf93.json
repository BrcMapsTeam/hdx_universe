{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected water bodies and inundated areas in Mocoa city, Putumayo department in Colombia as seen on Resourcesat-2 satellite imagery collected 04 April 2017. Heavy rainfall in the area caused flooding, landslides and mudflow that affected the city. UNOSAT extracted a water index from the satellite image to determine areas of standing water as well as soils with varying levels of water content (i.e. mud). Within the city of Mocoa and the current map extent, about 18 km of roads are potentially affected. About 2900 buildings are within areas which experienced floods and mudflow. It is likely that flood waters and inundation have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
