{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected potential damage following Cyclone Chapala in western Socotra Island, Socotra Governorate, Yemen. Using satellite imagery acquired 04 November 2015 compared with imagery from 27 October 2015, 10 and 23 September 2015, UNITAR-UNOSAT analyzed an area of approximately 2,157 square kilometers or roughly 59% of the island. A total of 81 potentially damaged structures were identified as of 04 November 2015. Many affected structures and boats were observed near the settlement of Qulansiyah. Detected damage likely reflects an underestimation due to significant cloud obstruction. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
