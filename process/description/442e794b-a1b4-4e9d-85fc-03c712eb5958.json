{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the Central region of Magway State in the areas of Chalin, Chauk, Pwinbyu, Yenangyaung, Magwe and Sagu Townships of Myanmar as imaged by the TerraSAR-X satellite on 6 August 2015. Waters along the Irrawaddy River have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the Irrawaddy river bank. Total surface covered with water in the analyzed area has increased from a pre-flood level of 6% to 15% during the flood period, and as of 6 August 2015 a total of ~60,000 ha of lands were affected. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
