{"notes": "The UNHCR Population Statistics database currently contains data about UNHCR's populations of concern from the year 2000 up to 2013. The data is the same available in [UNHCR's Yearbook Statistical Yearbook](http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a02afce6.html) publications.\r\n\r\nIn this dataset it is possible to investigate different aspects of the populations of concern: their general composition by location of residence or origin, their status (refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons, etc.), their evolution over time, and so on."}
