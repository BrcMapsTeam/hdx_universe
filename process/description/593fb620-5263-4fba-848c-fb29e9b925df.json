{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in a portion of the town of Sinjar in Sinjar District, Nineveh Province, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 18 November 2015 and 07 August 2014, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 1,293 potentially affected structures. Approximately 369 of these were destroyed, 336 severely damaged, 380 moderately damaged, and 208 possibly damaged. Note that due to less-than-ideal imagery characteristics the error margin for this analysis is likely higher than usual. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
