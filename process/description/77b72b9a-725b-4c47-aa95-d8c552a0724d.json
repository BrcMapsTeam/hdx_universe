{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Al Zaatari refugee camp in Mafraq Governorate, Jordan. As of 06 April 2014 a total of 31,280 shelters were detected as well as 1,796 infrastructure and support buildings within the 534.4 hectares of the camp. Between 07 January 2014 and 06 April 2014, a total of 3,443 shelters closed or were moved, and a total of 6,700 shelters were constructed, and the number of shelters has thus increased by about 3,257 since the previous UNITAR/UNOSAT assessment. This indicates an approximate 4.5% increase in the number of shelters between 07 January 2014 and 06 April 2014. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field; structure locations subject to a spatial error margin of +/- three meters. Shelters grouped under plastic sheeting were estimated by average household size and may be a source of error. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
