{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in a portion of the city of Kobane, Aleppo Governorate, Syria. Using satellite imagery acquired 22 January 2015, 6 December 2014, and 6 September 2014, UNITAR / UNOSAT identified a total of 3,247 affected structures by 22 January 2015 within the area analyzed. Approximately 1,206 of these were destroyed, 1,169 severely damaged, and 872 moderately damaged. A total of 979 impact craters were also identified within Kobane and its immediate surroundings. The inset images show craters likely caused by air strikes. By 6 December 2014 UNOSAT identified a total of eight craters possible caused by air strikes in the neighborhoods of Sanayi and Kaniya Kurdan and by 22 January 2015 an additional twelve were identified in the neighborhoods of Kaniya Kurdan and Saredari, a possible indicator of ongoing bombardment in the area. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
