{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected potentially affected shelters in Leda refugee camp in Nhilla Union, Cox s Bazar District, and Chittagong Division of Bangladesh. About 18,350 people are registered in this camp. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades satellite image acquired 05 June 2017 and could identify 215 possible damaged shelter structures within the extent of the camp. Kindly note that the number of damaged shelters could have been underestimated as some groups of shelter structures might be identified as one structure. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
