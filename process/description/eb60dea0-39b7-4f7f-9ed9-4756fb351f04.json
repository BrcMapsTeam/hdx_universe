{"notes": "This map illustrates IDP shelter changes near Doolow, Somalia as visible in satellite imagery acquired 15 September 2014. As of 15 September 2014, within Qansalay IDP settlement south west of Doolow, 904 shelters and 11 administrative buildings were detected and within Kabasa IDP settlement east of the city, 1,457 shelters and 20 administrative buildings were located and marked. Settlement conditions have changed greatly since previous analysis. As 3 March 2013, 99% of the shelters were improvised structures (buuls). As 15 September 2014, overall the number of detected shelters decreased but more importantly converted from improvised shelters into temporary housing or semi-permanent structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
