{"notes": "This map illustrates the satellite-detected water extent in the District of Khongxedone, Salavan Province, in the southwestern part of Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic after the tropical storm SONCA-17. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Sentinel-1 satellite image acquired on the 30 July 2017 and detected several areas with potentially standing waters. In the district of Khongxedone ~2,921 ha are likely flooded mostly affecting the central part of the district along the \u201cXe Don\u201d river. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
