{"notes": "Kenya\u2019s commitment to close down Dadaab by mid-2017, the world\u2019s largest refugee camp hosting over 300,000 Somalis, is putting increasing pressure on service delivery and infrastructure in Somalia. By October 2016, an estimate of 31,226 Somali people have returned from Kenya, the majority of which are heading to Kismayo, Baidoa, Luuq and Mogadishu. While the caseload of returnees is expected to continue growing over the coming months, there is no clear understanding of movement patterns of returnees or internally displaced persons which further complicates the attempts by humanitarian organisations to provide for required services.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a CCCM cluster in Somalia means that information on humanitarian needs and gaps has been limited to ad-hoc and un-coordinated assessments.  The Kismayo IDP settlement assessment was triggered as a result of the need for a multi-cluster, area-based and coordinated information approach for humanitarian planning and service delivery in informal IDP settlements in Somalia.\r\n\r\nThe Kismayo IDP Settlement Assessment was carried out with financial support from USAID-OFDA and ECHO and in close collaboration with clusters (WASH, Shelter & NFIs, Education, Food Security, Health, Nutrition and Protection)."}
