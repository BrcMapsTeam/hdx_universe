{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at Minkaman IDP Site in Lakes State, South Sudan, as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite on 24 November 2014. People displaced by ongoing instability in the region of Bor have established multiple IDP camps on the west bank of the White Nile in Awerial County. Imagery acquired on 1 September 2014 showed approximately 16,364 shelters and 670 infrastructure or support buildings occupying multiple areas along the White Nile. Imagery also showed an area being prepared for accommodating new shelters. As of 24 November 2014 this ground has been partially covered by shelters as well as other areas of the IDP site, and approximately 18,636 shelters and 640 infrastructure or support buildings have been detected. Note that IDPs sheltering under trees are not detected by this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT\n"}
