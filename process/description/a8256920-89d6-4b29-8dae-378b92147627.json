{"notes": "This map illustrates a density comparison of satellite-detected damages in Gaza Strip, which resulted from recent conflicts in this area in both 2009 and 2014. Damage levels used in this density analysis only concern structures that were destroyed or severely damaged. The 2014 analysis was generated using Pleiades imagery taken 14, 27 & 28th August 2014 and compared with a pre-crisis a Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014. The 2009 analysis was generated using WorldView 02 and GeoEye imagery taken 10 & 21st January 2009. The 2009 imagery however was reduced resolution so damages may have been underestimated for that time period. This Density comparison is to illustrate the level of damaged observed by UNOSAT between the two conflict events. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
