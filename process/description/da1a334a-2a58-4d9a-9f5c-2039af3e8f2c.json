{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the centre of  Sagaiang State in the areas of Kawlin, Kanbalu, Taze and Kyunhla Townships of Myanmar as imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellite on 18 July 2015 and compared with waters imaged by Landsat-8 satellite and acquired 29 April 2015. Heavy rains at the onset of the monsoon season have caused flooding and an expansion of the dam reservoir close to Kanbalu town. Waters extended to about 80% in the area covered by the map and this includes the expansion of the dam reservoir. However the dam reservoir does not seem to be overflowing as of the 18 July 2015. Note also, many of inundated areas are swamps which are regularly flooded in the rainy season and as the river expands. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
