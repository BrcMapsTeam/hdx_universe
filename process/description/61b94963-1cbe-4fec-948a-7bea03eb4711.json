{"notes": "The UrbanInfo provides updated information on these topics and also covers new topics, such as disaster, crime, migration, income inequalities and transport. It includes, for the first time, the City Prosperity Index with information on productivity; infrastructure development; environmental sustainability; quality of life; equity/social inclusion; and Composite Street Connectivity Index (CSCI). The CSCI is composed with three elements: proportion of land allocated to street (percent), street density (km/km2) and the intersection density (number of intersection per km2).\r\n\r\nThis version of UrbanInfo is designed by UN-HABITAT in collaboration with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Development Group (UNDG), with financial support from the United Nations Development Account and other partners."}
