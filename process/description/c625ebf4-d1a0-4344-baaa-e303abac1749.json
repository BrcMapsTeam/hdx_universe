{"notes": "This map illustrates the satellite-detected surface waters extent and evolution in Ha Tinh Province, Vietnam, as observed from the Sentinel-1 images acquired on 12 and 24 October 2016.  An increase of surface waters extent was observed from the 24 October 2016 image: ~26,400 ha of surface water were observed the 12 October 2016 and reached ~30,700 ha the 24 October 2016. All over the analysed zone, it corresponds to an evolution of about 16%. More specifically, in Tri River (Song Tri) lake and dam an increase of 177 ha was observed. For Ke Go Lake and dam, an evolution of 30% of the total surface water was observed in between the 12 October and the 24 October 2016.
