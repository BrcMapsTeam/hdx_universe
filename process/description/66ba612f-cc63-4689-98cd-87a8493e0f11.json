{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts of Southern Region of Malawi and in the Morrumbala District of Zambezia Province of Mozambique along the Shire River as detected by Landsat-7 imagery acquired 07 February 2015. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
