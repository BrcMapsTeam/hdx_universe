{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the centre of  Sagaing State in the areas of Kawlin, Kanbalu,Taze and Kyunhla Townships of Myanmar as imaged by the Radarsat-2 satellite on 30 July 2015 and compared with Sentinel-1 satellite data on 18 July 2015 and Landsat-8 satellite acquired 29 April 2015. There is a notable increase in the expansion of reservoir compared to the previous weeks. Note also, many of inundated areas are swamps which are regularly flooded in the rainy season and as the river expands. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
