{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected potential damaged structures in the city of Kunduz in Afghanistan, approximately 200 kilometers from the epicenter of the 26 October 2015 earthquake. Using a Pl\u00e9iades satellite image acquired 28 October 2015 and a WorldView-2 image acquired 21 October 2015, UNITAR/UNOSAT did not observe major destruction related to the earthquake in Kunduz. However, a total of 12 potentially affected structures in Kunduz were identified. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
