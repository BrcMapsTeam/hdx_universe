{"notes": "This map illustrates the refugee settlement in Al Azraq, Jordan as seen by the Pleiades satellite on 5 October 2015. Analysis by UNITAR-UNOSAT of the satellite image indicates a total of 14,227 structures are visible. This total includes 2,690 infrastructure and support buildings as well as 10,071 transitional shelters. Preparations are continuing so as to accommodate additional incoming refugees. The previous analysis done by UNOSAT using an image from 11 November 2014 detected a total of 12,761 infrastructure, support buildings and transitional shelters. This is an increase of approximately 0.5%. Water and sanitation services are also under development in multiple camp zones suitable for supporting thousands of proximate shelters. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
