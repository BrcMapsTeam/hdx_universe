{"notes": "This map illustrates the refugee camp currently under construction in Al Azraq, Jordan using an image collected by the WorldView-2 satellite on 28 December 2013. As of 28 December 2013 a total of 3,174 structures were detected in the camp, 2,431 infrastructure and support buildings and 743 tent structures. Preparations are continuing so as to accommodate additional incoming refugees. The previous analysis done by UNOSAT using an image from 14 September 2013 detected a total of 2,689 infrastructure, support buildings and shelters. This is an increase of approximately 18%. Paved and unpaved roads have likewise increased significantly and define the transportation network in and around the camp. Water and sanitation services are also under development in multiple camp zones suitable for supporting thousands of proximate shelters. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
