{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the western part of Rakhine State in the townships of Ann, Kyaukpyu, Toungup and Myebon, Myanmar as imaged by the SENTINEL-1 satellite on 11 July 2015. Heavy rains at the onset of the monsoon season have caused limited flooding. The most affected lands seem to be mainly agricultural and/or paddy fields, many of which are of course frequently inundated at other times as well. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
