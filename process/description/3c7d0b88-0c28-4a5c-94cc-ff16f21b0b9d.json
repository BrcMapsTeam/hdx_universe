{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of landslide damage in the village of Ab Barek, Badakshan, Afghanistan. Following heavy rains in the region, a landslide partially buried Ab Barek on 2 May 2014. Using a satellite image acquired 5 May 2014 by the WorldView-2 satellite, UNOSAT delineated the landslide area. In addition, areas of IDPs, relief operations, and water pooling due to the landslide are indicated as of 5 May. The 5 May 2014 image was compared to an image from 7 June 2013 in an attempt to determine how many structures were buried, and a total of 87 such structures were located. However, between 7 June 2013 and the occurrence of the landslide Ab Barek had changed and grown considerably, and thus its possible additional buried structures exist which are not identified in this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
