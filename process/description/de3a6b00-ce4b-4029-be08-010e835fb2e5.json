{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected surface water extent in Elegu town and surroundings using a Sentinel-1 satellite image acquired on the 23 August 2017. Within the map extent, surface waters extended of about 12% more particularly south and north-west of Elugu where evidences of floods could be observed. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the characteristics of the satellite data used. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
