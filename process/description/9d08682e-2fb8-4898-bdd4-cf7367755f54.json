{"notes": "This map illustrates locations of destroyed structures in Bossangoa, Central African Republic. Using a satellite image acquired 28 February 2014 and compared to images from 22 January 2014 and 5 December 2013, UNOSAT reviewed the town of Bossangoa and surrounding areas to locate signs of destroyed structures. A total of 1,234 destroyed structures were located in the area, though structures marked as destroyed on 5 December are classed as \"probable\" due to the lack of a previous image for comparison. Some of the destruction detected in the 28 February 2014 image was likely a result of burning given the blackened structural remains visible in the imagery. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
