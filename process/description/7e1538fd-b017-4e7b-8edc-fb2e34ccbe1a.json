{"notes": "This map illustrates potentially damaged structures and buildings in the Central and Southern parts of Dominica (St. Patrick, St. Mak, St. George, St. Luke, St. David & St. Paul Parishes) as detected by satellite image acquired after landfall of the Tropical Cyclone Maria-17 on 19 September 2017. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis combined with Copernicus analysis, identified 12,873 potentially damaged structures in this zone. Taking into account the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, this represents about 70 % of the total number of structures within the analyzed areas. Please note that some areas could not be analyzed due to the cloud cover. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
