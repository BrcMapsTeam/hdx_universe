{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of destruction in the town of Rubkona as seen by the Ikonos satellite on 13 January 2014. UNOSAT analyzed all structures in the town to verify reports of damage and determined that the majority of the town has been destroyed, primarily by fire. A total of 3,996 burned or otherwise destroyed structures were identified throughout the town center as well as in outlying areas surrounding Rubkona. In addition, indications of looting consisting of debris piles were evident in multiple locations. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
