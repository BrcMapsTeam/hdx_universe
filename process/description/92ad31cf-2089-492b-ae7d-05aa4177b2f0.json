{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of destruction in the town of Mayom as seen by the Pleiades satellite on 11 January 2014. UNOSAT analyzed all structures in the town to verify reports of damage and determined that the majority of the town has been destroyed primarily by fire. A total of 1,801 burned or otherwise destroyed structures were identified throughout the town center as well as in outlying areas surrounding Mayom. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
