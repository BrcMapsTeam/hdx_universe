{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings in the Bentiu UNMISS  base as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite on 31 October 2015. Imagery collected on this date shows that the IDPs within the base Protection of Civilian (PoCs) areas has increased by more than 12% since the previous UNOSAT analysis, done using an image collected 7 March 2015. As of 31 October 2015, a total of 12,641 shelters were detected within the PoCs and  Contingency zones, but excluding structures within the UNMISS base boundary. Specifically, 10,925 structures were tent shelters and 1,685 were camp infrastructure buildings. The remaining 31 structures where found outside the delineated areas and consisted mainly of sentry posts and watch towers. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR -UNOSAT."}
