{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of IDP shelters in the UN House compound in Juba, Central Equatoria, South Sudan. UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis of WorldView-1 satellite imagery acquired 27 June 2016 revealed a total of 8,477 shelters as well as 231 infrastructure and support buildings within the compound. This represents an increase of approximately 3.2 percent in shelters and a decrease of roughly 3.3 percent in infrastructure and support buildings since the previous UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis of 25 September 2015 satellite imagery. While no structures were detected within PoC2, containers were visible in this area on 27 June 2016, as seen in inset 2. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
