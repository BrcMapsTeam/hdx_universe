{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the northwestern part of Rakhine State in the townships of Kyauktaw, Mrauk-U and Ponnagyun, Myanmar as imaged by the SENTINEL-1 satellite on 14 July 2016. Heavy rains at the onset of the monsoon season have caused flooding. The most affected lands seem to be mainly agricultural and/or paddy fields, many of which are of course frequently inundated at other times as well. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
