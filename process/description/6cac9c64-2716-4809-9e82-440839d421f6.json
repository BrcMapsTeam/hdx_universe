{"notes": "The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) partnered with donors and UN agencies and took up the lead role to support the Somali authorities in undertaking the Population Estimation Survey (PESS) for Somalia in October 2013- March 2014.\r\n\r\nPESS gathered basic critical information on the Somalis living in urban, rural and nomadic areas (interviewed at water points during the peak of the long, dry season), and in settlements for internally displaced persons. One standard questionnaire was used in selected enumeration areas or pre-identified areas. Data was collected in three main phases: cartographic field mapping, household listing in the sampled areas, and the interviewing of households using the standard questionnaire.\r\n\r\nPESS report by UNFPA had only the population estimate at regional level (Admin level 1). With the demand to get this data disaggregated to district level to enhance assessment and in particular assessments of people in food insecure by FAO-FSNAU, the district data was interpolated using FSNAU livelihood information embedded in the 2005 UNDP district level population data\r\n"}
