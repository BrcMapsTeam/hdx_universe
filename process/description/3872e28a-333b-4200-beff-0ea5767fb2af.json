{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters over western Rakhine State, Myanmar, in the areas of Ann and south of Myebon townships, as imaged by the ALOS-2 / PALSAR satellite on 12 August 2015. In the analyzed area a total of ~3,800 ha of lands are affected by floods, mainly agricultural and/or paddy fields. The surface covered with water in the analyzed area has increased from a pre-flood level of 3.8% to 4.6% during the flood period. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas near the main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
