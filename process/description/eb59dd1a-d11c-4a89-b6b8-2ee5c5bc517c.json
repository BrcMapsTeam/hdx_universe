{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite detected possible flood water & saturated soil over Wad Madani, in Al Jazeera State, extracted from Radarsat-2 imagery (12 m) acquired on 18 August 2016. According to satellite derived analysis some areas within Al Jazeera State seem to be flooded. Possible flooded agricultural areas and saturated soils are particularly visible over Southern Al Jazeera Locality. The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Detected water bodies likely reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
