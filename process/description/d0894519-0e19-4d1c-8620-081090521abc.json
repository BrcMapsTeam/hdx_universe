{"notes": "This map illustrates locations of destroyed structures in the Bouar area of Central African Republic. Using a satellite image acquired 04 March 2014 by the WorldView-2 satellite, UNOSAT reviewed the town of Bouar and surrounding areas to locate signs of destroyed structures. A total of 506 destroyed structures were identified as of 4 March 2014, and a previous UNOSAT analysis using an image from 22 January 2014 indicated that 366 of the structures were destroyed as of that date. Some of the visible destruction is possibly the result of burning given the blackened structural remains visible in the imagery. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
