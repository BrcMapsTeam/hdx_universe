{"notes": "This dataset was collected as a part of a  follow-up monitoring exercise after an initial assessment of Shelter and WASH needs\r\n conducted in December 2013. \r\nThe purpose of this monitoring assessment was to determine the extent of shelter and WASH assistance, namely what has been provided to beneficiaries and to assess whether there were people that had not received assistance. With a focus on measuring recovery trends, the assessment aims to understand whether households are building back better and to understand beneficiary satisfaction with assistance received and awareness of recovery practices. The assessment is also intended to inform identification and targeting of key vulnerable groups.\r\n\r\nThe assessment was conducted by REACH as part of its partnership with the Global Shelter Cluster. In the Philippines, the shelter cluster is led by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and supported by the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) as cluster leads. The WASH Cluster Rapid Assessment Team\r\n(RAT) provided the assessment with technical and logistical support both remotely and directly in the field in collaboration with the Shelter Cluster."}
