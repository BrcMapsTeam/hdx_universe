{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Minawao refugee settlement, Mayo-Tsanaga District, Far North Province, in Cameroon as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite on 10 March 2015. UNOSAT analyzed a total of 5,220 structures (4,027 tent shelters, 903 improvised shelters and 290 administrative buildings) within the 261 hectares of the settlement area. Note that apparently adjoining, contiguous shelters were counted as a single shelter which may thus underestimate total number of shelters. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT"}
