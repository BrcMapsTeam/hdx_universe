{"notes": "Road network of Liberia\r\n\r\nThis dataset represents roads network within Liberia. These data are part of the government-derived shape files provided by UNDP in January 2007.  This dataset was derived from NIMA Vmap L1 and a survey by UNMIL Irish team, then anaylised and updated by UNMIL GIS Unit using Landsat imagery. New roads were digitized from the Landsat and non-existing roads were deleted from the source datasets. The attributes include category, names, description and assessment roads planning.\r\n"}
