{"notes": "Data used for the statistical model to predict the number of fatalities following an earthquake as in Nepal. The model predicting death counts, developed using zero-inflated negative binomial regression to account for excess zeros and over-dispersion, then converted into indices that measure relative priority in terms of predicted death counts, predicted death rate (predicted death count divided by total population), and predicted death density (predicted death count divided by area).
