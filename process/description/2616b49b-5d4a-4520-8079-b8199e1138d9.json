{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Al Zaatari refugee camp in Mafraq Governorate, Jordan. As of 06 July 2014 a total of 29,982 shelters were detected as well as 1,880 infrastructure and support buildings within the 534.4 hectares of the camp. Between 06 April 2014 and 06 July 2014, a total of 4,257 shelters closed or were moved, and a total of 2,774 shelters were constructed, and the number of shelters has thus decreased by about 1,298 since the previous UNITAR/UNOSAT assessment. This indicates an approximate 4.1% decrease in the number of shelters between 06 April 2014 and 06 July 2014. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field; structure locations subject to a spatial error margin of +/- three meters. Shelters grouped under plastic sheeting were estimated by average household size and may be a source of error. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
