{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of flood affected land as detected in a TerraSAR-X image acquired 15 September 2014 in the Multan area, Punjab Province (Pakistan). The area along Chenab River and the agricultural areas west of Multan along Chenab River are most likely inundated by floods caused by monsoon rains. Due to sensor limitations, flood waters could be underestimated in urban areas. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
