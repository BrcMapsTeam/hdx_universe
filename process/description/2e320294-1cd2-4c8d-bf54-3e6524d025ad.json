{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the Sinjar area of Nineveh Province, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 18 and 28 November 2015, 30 December 2014, and 07 August 2014, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 2,383 potentially affected structures. Approximately 810 of these were destroyed, 685 severely damaged, 519 moderately damaged, and 369 possibly damaged. Note that due to less-than-ideal imagery characteristics the error margin for this analysis is likely higher than usual, and due to terrain distortion the spatial accuracy is +/- 15 meters. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
