{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected possible damaged shelter structures in Kutupalong Refugee Camp, Palong Khali Union and Cox Bazar District, Chittagong Division, Bangladesh. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used Pleiades satellite imagery acquired the 6th and the 7th June 2017 as post-images. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis identified 1,105 possible damaged shelter structures within the extent of the camp. Kindly note that the number of possible shelter damaged structures could have been under or overestimated in some areas due to the cloud cover and the delimitation of the camp extent. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR \u2013 UNOSAT."}
