{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected destroyed or otherwise damaged structures in Maungdaw and Buthindaung townships, Maungdaw District, Myanmar, as seen in satellite imagery collected on 16 September 2017. The analysis found a total area of more than 20 square kilometers of destroyed structures within the 2,000 square kilometers analyzed. According to other data on town locations it is likely that more than 160 towns are affected within the area analyzed. Additionally, 144 fires were detected within the area between 25 August and 21 September 2017 by the MODIS and VIIRS sensors, with recent fire detections indicating destruction is likely ongoing. Most of the detected fires are located in the proximity of the affected areas as observed in the imagery collected 16 September. Finally, heavy cloud cover during the period in question, and on 16 September especially, indicates that destruction and fire detections are likely underestimated in this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
