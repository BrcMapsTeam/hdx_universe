{"notes": "Between November 2016 and February 2017, mapping and profiling of informal settlements in Afghanistan was conducted. Initial secondary data review was carried out in Baghlan, Balkh, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar and Nangarhar, providing the locations of pre-recognised informal settlements within the provinces. These sites were then verified and built upon by field teams, carrying out key informant interviews to provide comprehensive information on demographics in each site. Field teams also conducted direct mapping data collection. As data collection progressed, further sites were added to broaden geographic coverage. The intention is to include every informal settlements within targeted provinces, until all sites in Afghanistan are mapped and profiled. The dataset is anticipated to be updated on a monthly basis.
