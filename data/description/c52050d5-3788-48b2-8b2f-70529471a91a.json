{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected waters in the Jowhar, Middle Shabelle region of Somalia. Using satellite imagery acquired 16 November 2015 and 02 January 2015, UNITAR-UNOSAT identified a total affected area of roughly 8,300 hectares in the Shabelle Dhexe and Hoose provinces. As of 16 November 2015, approximately 8,300 hectares of probable standing rain waters were detected over the districts of Jowhar, Balcad and, Afgooye. Due to the characteristics of satellite data used for this analysis, the exact limit of flood water is uncertain. Detected water bodies likely reflect an underestimation of all flood-affected areas within the map extent. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT. Pre-flood assessment performed by SWALIM."}
