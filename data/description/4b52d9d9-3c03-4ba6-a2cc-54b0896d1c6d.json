{"notes": "This dataset illustrates satellite-detected potential damaged buildings in Anguilla Island, following the landfall of Tropical Cyclone IRMA-17 on September 6, 2017. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Kompsat-3 satellite image acquired on 9 February 2017 and WorldView-2 image acquired on 5 July 2017 as pre-imagery and Pleiades satellite imagery acquired on the 7 & 8 September 2017 as a post-imagery. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis identified 2,147 potentially damaged structures within the analyzed area that was not covered by clouds. According to the pre-building footprints, inside the area free of clouds, provided by Humanitarian Open Street Map, this represents 42% of potentially affected structures in Anguilla."}
