{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage in Old City, Mosul, Ninawa Governorate, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 18 July 2017, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 6,981 affected structures within this part of city. This marks an overall increase of 26% in damage affected structures from the previous assessment of the 30 June. Approximately 1,202 of these were destroyed (17% of the total affected buildings), 3,982 severely damaged (57% of the total affected buildings) and 1,797 moderately damaged (26% of the total affected buildings). This marks a 145% increase in destroyed buildings, 4% in moderately damaged buildings and 20% severely damaged buildings from the 30 June assessment. The most heavily impacted areas appear to be the Ras al-Kur (see inset) and the Maydan neighbourhoods. Due to the densely constructed nature of this part of the city, these values might be underestimated. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
