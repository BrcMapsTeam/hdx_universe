{"notes": "These sites are those reported as visited or pending/onoing ('to visit' in the status column) as of end 28 April 2015.\r\nThe 'visited' coordinates come from the international Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) team reports as provided to the Virtual OSOCC and to the USAR coordination centre and are from GPS.\r\nThe 'to visit' sites come from the government of Nepal as a list of names to which we have attempted to assign coordinates.\r\nThe site names are often ambiguous so these coordinates are approximate.\r\nThe list of visited sites is incomplete because there are international USAR teams that have not reported their visited sites.\r\nAlso, this list DOES NOT INCLUDE NEPALI USAR TEAM SITES VISITED.\r\nThis list was compiled by MapAction (www.mapaction.org)\r\n"}
