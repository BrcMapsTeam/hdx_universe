{"notes": "This map illustrates areas affected by Pico de Fogo volcano as seen in a WorldView-2 image acquired 25 November 2014 and LANDSAT-8 data acquired the 24 of November. The lava flow is continuing from the subsidiary vent located in the western flank of the Pico de Fogo Mountain and magma and the lava reached the areas close to Portela, Cha Das Caldeiras and Bangaeira villages. About 3400 meters of the main road and 4600 m of secondary roads and paths in the caldera are affected and are potentially out of use (i.e. 8000 m of roadways potentially affected). The inset of this map illustrates the incandescent lava and smoke as seen with false colors as captured by WorldView-2 satellite. ~150 ha of lava could be observed on the 24 November 2014 and ~260 ha the on 25 November 2014. Note that the lava flow is likely underestimated because of smoke especially in the areas close to the vent. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
