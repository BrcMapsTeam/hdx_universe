{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of IDPs in the UNMISS Rubkona base as seen by the Ikonos satellite on 13 January 2014 and the WorldView-2 satellite on 2 January 2014. Fleeing outbreaks of violence, a portion of the UNMISS compound is in use by IDPs, occupying more than 3.9 ha by 13 January, compared to 2.6 ha as of 2 January 2013. Note that IDP occupied areas include improvised shelters and, in some cases, administrative support and other structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
