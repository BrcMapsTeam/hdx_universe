{"notes": "The market monitoring system was developed by the Cash-Based Responses Technical Working Group and REACH Turkey, after the CBR \u2013 TWG identified that monitoring markets on a regular basis in Syria was key to understand how markets function and cope with the challenges brought by the conflict, as well as with rough climate conditions. The market monitoring system also aims at informing program design to utilise existing markets, notably through cash-based responses and food assistance, to promote beneficiary empowerment and cost efficiency. Field staff will monitor prices and stock levels of basic commodities in markets in northern Syria on a monthly basis to inform and guide cash and voucher programs, as well as food assistance, for populations relying on the assessed markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\nThe Market Assessment was carried out by partner organizations of the CBR - TWG and REACH, following an initiative launched by the Cash-Based Responses - Technical Working Group. This project is being funded by OFDA. "}
