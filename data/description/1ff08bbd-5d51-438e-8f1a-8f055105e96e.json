{"notes": "This map illustrates water bodies at the Tokwe Mukorsi Dam, Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe, as detected by TerraSAR-X on 11 February 2014. The flooded area above the dam has greatly increased due to recent heavy rains and currently encompasses about 2,300 ha. Using a WorldView-1 image acquired on 2 January 2012, UNOSAT located a total of 751 structures in 143 homestead locations that would be submerged by the current flood water extent. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
