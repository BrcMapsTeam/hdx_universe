{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected water extent and evolution in the eastern part of Bangladesh as imaged by the SENTINEL-1 satellite on 30 June 2016 and 24 July 2016. The analysis shows an expansion of waters of 75% between the two dates within the entire analyzed zone. Heavy rains at the onset of the Monsoon season have caused flooding. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field.\u00a0Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
