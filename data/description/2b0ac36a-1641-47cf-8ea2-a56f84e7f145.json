{"notes": "This dataset details changes to multidimensional poverty over time for 34 countries and their sub-national regions where possible. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) reflects the combined simultaneous disadvantages poor people experience across different areas of their lives, including education, health and living standards. If people are deprived in at least one-third of ten weighted indicators, they are identified as multi-dimensionally poor. For further information on the MPI visit: http://www.ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/\r\n\r\nThe dataset is an appendix to the Methodological Note \u2013 Winter 2014/2015 (http://www.ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/mpi-2014-2015/mpi-methodology/) and Multidimensional Poverty Dynamics:  Methodology and Results for 34 countries (http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/OPHI-RP-41a.pdf?0a8fd7).\r\n\r\nPlease site the data as: Alkire, S., J.
