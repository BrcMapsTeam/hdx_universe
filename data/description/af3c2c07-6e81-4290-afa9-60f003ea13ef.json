{"notes": "\"This dataset presents district level estimates of twelve different measures of poverty, calorie intake and malnutrition for 2011 and 2001. The dataset is extracted from https://github.com/prabhasp/NepalMaps/tree/gh-pages/Poverty. The data has been mapped to the districts of nepal at http://prabhasp.github.io/NepalMaps/Poverty/ by Prabhas Pokharel (prabhas.pokharel@gmail.com) and Suveg Pandey.\nThe definition of the columns are:\nPoverty incidence for a given area is defined as the proportion of individuals living in that area who are in households with an average per capita expenditure below the poverty line.\nPoverty gap is the average distance below the poverty line, being zero for those individuals above the line. It thus represents the resources needed to bring all poor individuals up to a basic level.\nPoverty severity measures the average squared distance below the line, thereby giving more weight to the very poor.\"\n"}
