{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the Southern region of Bago State in the areas of Nyaungiebin, Daik-U, Waw, Shwegyin and Kyauktaga townships of Myanmar as imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellite on 6 August 2015. Waters along the Sittang River have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the river bank. Total surface covered with water in the analyzed area has increased from a pre-flood level of 3% to 20% during the flood period, and as of 6 August 2015 a total of ~70,000 ha of lands were affected. Most of the affected lands south of Daik-U town seem to be mainly agricultural fields, many of which are of course frequently inundated at other times as well. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
