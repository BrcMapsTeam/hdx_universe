{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Al Zaatari refugee camp in Mafraq Governorate, Jordan. As of 11 November 2014 a total of 29,243 shelters were detected as well as 1,915 infrastructure and support buildings within the 534.4 hectares of the camp. Between 06 July 2014 and 11 November 2014, a total of 2,779 shelters closed or were moved, and a total of 1,910 shelters were constructed, and the number of shelters has thus decreased by about 739 since the previous UNITAR/UNOSAT assessment. This indicates an approximate 2.5% decrease in the number of shelters between 06 July 2014 and 11 November 2014. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field; structure locations subject to a spatial error margin of +/- three meters. Shelters grouped under plastic sheeting were estimated by average household size and may be a source of error. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
