{"notes": "This map illustrates a land cover classification along Kapuas River in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. It is derived from Landsat-8 multispectral imagery acquired on 3 August 2015 at 30 meter pixel resolution. The classification is divided into seven main classes: dense vegetation/forest, shrub/disturbed forest, agricultural areas, water, exposed sands/mining, affected waters/mining pits, and exposed soils. The inset table summarizes the total area for each class in the region analyzed. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
