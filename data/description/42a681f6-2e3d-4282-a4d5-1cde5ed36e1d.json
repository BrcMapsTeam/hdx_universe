{"notes": "This dataset is an extraction of roads from OpenStreetMap data made by WFP following UNSDI-T standards.\r\nThe data is updated in near-real time from OSM servers and include all latest updates.\r\nNOTE: this dataset doesn't include main roads that have been published on a separate dataset (Nigeria Road Network (main roads)).\r\n\r\nCAUTION: The dataset is quite heavy (~17Mb). To download only a subset of it (by bounding box or filtering the data), please go to the WFP geonode page of this dataset : http://geonode.wfp.org/layers/ogcserver.gis.wfp.org%3Ageonode%3Anga_trs_streets_osm"}
