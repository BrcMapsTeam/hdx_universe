Between 11 December 2014 and 21 January 2015 flood waters affected roughly 55,000 hectares of lands in the five listed districts. About 31 villages are located within the flooded zone and according to the World Population database around 33,500 people are located within these potentially affected areas.  This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
