{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in areas of Nuseirat, Al Burayj, Al Ruwaydah, Nahal Qatif and Al Musadar in Gaza due to ongoing violence in the area. Using a satellite image collected 12 July 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT analysis has identified 41 destroyed structures, 13 severely damaged structures, and 29 moderately damaged structures. In addition, 45 craters in agricultural and non-urbanized areas are also visible as of 12 July 2014. Further analysis will be done as additional imagery is collected. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
