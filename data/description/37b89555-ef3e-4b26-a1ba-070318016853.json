{"notes": "An overview of the administrative divisions for Armenia (taxonomy), including geographic boundaries for admin levels 0, 1, 2 and 3. \r\n\r\nThe admin1 and admin3 overviews are taken from the National Statistical Service (including the Pcodes they assigned). The second administrative level is not an official administrative level, but sometimes used by Government agencies. It was obtained from the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Armenia (including the \"RegionID\" which they assigned).\r\n\r\nAdded a preceding 0 to the pcode of admin2 levels belonging to admin1 units 01-09, to ensure consistency in the number of digits (3).\r\nFor admin1 and admin3 levels, names in Armenian and English are from the National Statistics Service. Russian names and alternative English names are from the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Armenia.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Regional Office for Caucasus, Central Asia and Ukraine (ROCCA) received the geographic boundaries on 10 October 2014 from the State Committee of the Real Property Cadastre of the Government of the Republic of Armenia. The source of the dataset is the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Armenia.\r\n\r\nThere has just been a reform on the hamaynkner/communities, which explains why the correct geographical boundaries are not available yet. The resources above include different unprocessed shapefiles of the previous admin3 boundaries, before the reform. These need to be used with caution - some have projection issues.\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are inconsistencies in the country outline between the various admin boundaries.\r\n\r\nITOS is planning to review these datasets in 2017."}
