{"notes": "On the 26th of October 2015, a large scale earthquake caused shelter damage throughout much of northern and central Afghanistan.  During August 2016, the REACH Initiative (supported by ACTED, AfghanAid and People in Need) conducted a shelter response evaluation in 3 districts of Afghanistan on behalf of the Shelter Cluster.  The aim of the assessment was to evaluate shelter interventions and locate possible intervention gaps in order to inform the shelter cluster of Afghanistan of the current shelter context and needs of earthquake affected families. The assessment consisted of three specific areas of investigation:\r\n1.\tTo monitor change in sheltering conditions for families\r\n2.\tTo evaluate the value of various shelter interventions in allowing families to recover and to identify possible gaps\r\n3.\tTo determine recovery limitations and successes relating to vulnerable groups\r\n"}
