{"notes": "This spatial dataset of major rivers provides the delimitation of major  water courses in Afghanistan. It comprises 24  water course features, which are attributed with a hydrological description and watercourse name (English). \r\n\r\nThis dataset was last modified by the OCHA IMU in January 2013. The scales at which the original datasets were created are unknown, but it is likely that they were digitized at a scale of around 1:500,000. The purpose of this dataset is to show major rivers at a provincial scale or higher.\r\n\r\nThe multiple sources of the data are as follows: South East Asia Rivers, USAID map of ongoing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan; Foreign and Commonwealth Office Library map series 230 (2005); and an alternative country river line dataset (custodian unknown).\r\n"}
