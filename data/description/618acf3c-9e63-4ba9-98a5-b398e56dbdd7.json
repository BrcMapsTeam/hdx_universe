{"notes": "Continual assessment of issues directly affecting community safety and security is critical to effective evidence based programming, informed decision making and measuring the impact of related programmatic interventions: it enables a better understanding of what works and doesn\u2019t work at the community level. With this in mind district level assessments map out and provide a better understanding of issues that affect targeted communities across the Somali regions. By using key indicators for selected thematic areas, this report provides an assessment on the state of conflict, governance, justice as well as safety and security in the Western Zone of Mogadishu."}
