{"notes": "Here we provide version 1 Flowminder (www.flowminder.org) human mobility models for West Africa, together with WorldPop population density data for the region, to support ongoing efforts to control the ebola outbreak. Before downloading any data, please read the documention carefully as it provides details on the datasets and models provided through the links below. The mobility data refer to estimated patterns before the Ebola outbreak and should be interpreted with caution for Ebola affected countries as mobility patters are known to have changed.\r\n\r\nAdditional discussion by the authors around the use of mobile operator data for epidemilogical research see:  http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/containing-the-ebola-outbreak-the-potential-and-challenge-of-mobile-network-data/"}
