{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected fires and environmental damage at and around Al Qayyarah, approximately 60 Km south of Mosul, Iraq. The main frame shows fires and the oil spill as seen in imagery collected between 23 December 2016 and 24 January 2017. Marked in blue are fires that were detected in 23 December 2016 but appear inactive as of 24 January 2017. Insets on the left show the oil spill north of Al Qayyarah, detected with both radar and optical imagery from multiple dates. As seen in the imagery, the oil spill is very close to one of the streams which is incidentally a tributary to the Tigris River; therefore, it is possible that oil is spilling to the river. The spectral signature from thermal imagery also suggest that areas of the oil spill are on fire. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
