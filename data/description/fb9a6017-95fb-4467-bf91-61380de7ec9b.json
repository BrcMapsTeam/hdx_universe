{"notes": "This dataset is the INDICATIVE boundaries of the Barangays as observed at the end of April 2016 as per the Philippine Geographic Standard Code (PSGC) dataset. It has been generated on the basis of the layer created by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in the context of the 2015 population census. LMB is still the source of official administrative boundaries of the Philippines. In the absence of available official administrative boundary, the IMTWG have agreed to clean and use the PSA administrative boundaries which are used to facilitate data collection of surveys and censuses.
