{"notes": "This tabular dataset provides the Afghanistan population estimation for the Persian calendar year 1395 (corresponding to the Gregorian period 21 March 2016 to 20 March 2017) disaggregated by districts and provincial centres (admin level 3), age, gender, and urban-rural settled populations. The total population of the country in 1395 is estimated to be around 29.1 million, which is inclusive of the 1.5 million nomadic population.\r\n\r\nThis dataset format was created on 15 August 2016 by the Information Management Unit (IMU) of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Afghanistan. Since the Afghanistan Geodesy and Cartography Head Office (AGCHO) is recognized as the sole authoritative source a for administrative boundaries, the population estimates have also been matched to the administrative names and codes of the AGCHO dataset. The dataset include popluation estimates disaggregated by CSO province and district codes (including Kabul city districts), population estimates disaggreated by AGCHO district codes, and a lookup table that relates CSO, AGCHO and AIMS legacy codes. Note that the 1.5 million nomadic population is NOT included in the province and district population estimates. Estimated population disaggregated by age group and gender is calculated using proportion of the total estimated population falling under each cohort based on 2011/2012 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) report. This data is only available at the province level.\r\n\r\nThis is the **current version** of the population estimates. The 2015/2016 projections can be found on https://data.humdata.org/dataset/estimated-population-of-afghanistan-2015-2016"}
