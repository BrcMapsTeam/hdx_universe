{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of landslide damage in the village of Ab Barek, Badakshan, Afghanistan. Following heavy rains in the region, a landslide partially buried Ab Barek on 2 May 2014. Using a satellite image acquire 3 May 2014 by the WorldView-1 satellite, UNOSAT delineated the primary landslide area as well as a probable secondary area directly affected by the slide. Using a lower resolution Landsat-8 image collected 30 March 2014, a probably area of buried housing is also indicated though this should be treated as preliminary and speculative. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
