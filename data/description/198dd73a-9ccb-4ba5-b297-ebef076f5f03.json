{"notes": "This dataset is an extraction of roads from OpenStreetMap data made by WFP following UNSDI-T standards. The data is updated in near-real time from OSM servers and include all latest updates. NOTE: this dataset doesn't include streets that have been published on a separate dataset (Democratic Republic of the Congo, streets and pathways).\r\n\r\nIt also includes the latest information on access constraints published by the Logistics Cluster in D.R.C.\r\n\r\nCAUTION: The dataset is quite heavy (~30Mb). To download only a subset of it (by bounding box or filtering the data), please go to the WFP geonode page of this dataset : http://geonode.wfp.org/layers/ogcserver.gis.wfp.org%3Ageonode%3Acod_trs_roads_osm#"}
