{"notes": "This map shows landslides mapped from satellite imagery following the Regent event on 15 August 2017. The main landslide outline in Regent has been updated from the product released by UNITAR-UNOSAT (published 16 August, version 1.0) using the updated UNITAR-UNOSAT georectification of the satellite image on 17th August.\r\nThe main Regent landslide event is 6 km long, including source area and run-out to the sea. It is interpreted as a debris slide in its upper reaches, transitioning to a debris flow and then a sediment-laden flood. The two smaller landslides are interpreted as debris flow events. The analysis has not yet been verified in the field."}
