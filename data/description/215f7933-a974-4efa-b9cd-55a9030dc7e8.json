{"notes": "This map illustrates the refugee camp currently under construction in Al Azraq, Jordan. Using an image collected by the WorldView-1 satellite on 11 November 2014 a total of 12,761 structures were detected. This total includes 2,690 infrastructure and support buildings as well as 10,071 transitional shelters. Preparations are continuing so as to accommodate additional incoming refugees. The previous analysis done by UNOSAT using an image from 26 April 2014 detected a total of 7,333 infrastructure, support buildings and transitional shelters. This is an increase of approximately 74%. Paved and unpaved roads have likewise increased significantly and define the transportation network in and around the camp. Water and sanitation services are also under development in multiple camp zones suitable for supporting thousands of proximate shelters. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
