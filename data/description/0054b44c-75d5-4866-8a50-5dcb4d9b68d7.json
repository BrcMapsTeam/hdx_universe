{"notes": "This map illustrates areas affected by Pico de Fogo volcano as seen in a Landsat-8 image acquired 24 November 2014. The 23 November 2014 eruption, the first since 1995, occurred through a subsidiary vent located in the western flank of the Pico de Fogo mountain. The main cone seems to be not involved in the eruption as of the 24 November 2014 image acquisition. About 5,700 meters of roadways in the caldera area seem to be affected by the lava flow and are potentially out of use including the road from the Caldera to Sao Felipe city. The inset of this map illustrates the lava flow and smoke as seen with false colours as captured by Landsat-8 image. Note that the lava flow is likely underestimated because of smoke. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT.\n"}
