{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected water bodies at the Tokwe Mukorsi Dam, Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe, as imaged by TerraSAR-X on 18 February 2014. The flooded area above the dam has decreased slightly since the previous analysis using an image from 11 February 2014 and currently encompasses about 2,278 ha. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
