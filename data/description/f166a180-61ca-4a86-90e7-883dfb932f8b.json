{"notes": "Energy projects are being implemented in humanitarian contexts across the globe. These excel spreadsheets include all known past and present energy projects that have taken place in refugee camps, IDP communities, and other crisis-affected populations throughout the world, and were collected by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves on behalf of the Safe Access to Fuel & Energy (SAFE) Humanitarian Working Group. To view full descriptions of the projects represented here, please visit www.safefuelandenergy.org/where-we-work. \r\n\r\nThis project listing was created as part of an effort to enhance coordination of activities, encourage collaboration, and share knowledge between organizations working on Safe Access to Fuel and Energy (SAFE) in humanitarian settings.  Projects included in this database are those that improve access to fuel or energy for cooking, lighting, heating, or powering among crisis-affected populations. By crisis-affected populations we mean refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs), or those affected by natural disaster or prolonged conflict.\r\n\r\nExamples of applicable energy interventions include providing solar lighting, manufacturing and/or distributing cookstoves and fuels, setting up mini grids for camp electrification, establishing and managing woodlots for fuel provision and environmental protection, improving protection mechanisms for women during firewood collection, and many others, provided they take place among crisis-affected populations.\r\n\r\nThe SAFE Humanitarian Working Group is a consortium of partners including UNHCR, FAO, WFP, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, the Women's Refugee Commission, International Lifeline Fund, Mercy Corps, UNICEF, and other agencies.\r\n\r\nIf you know of additional energy projects that are not shown here, please contact us at info@safefuelandenergy.org.
