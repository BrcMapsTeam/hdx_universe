{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected internally displaced persons shelters in the village tract of Nyaung Pin Gyi, Maungdaw Township, Rakhine State. Using satellite imagery collected on 6 November 2017 UNOSAT identified a total of 457 shelters in a beach area 7 km south of Maungdaw town, next to the mouth of the Naf River between Myanmar and Bangladesh. Several unidentified trucks are observed on the road located adjacent to the internally displaced persons settlement. As of 11 November 2017, 307 shelters were identified which represents a 33 percent decrease from 6 November. Additionally, several likely rafts are observed by the shoreline on 11 November 2017. Additional imagery analysis indicates this settlement began before 6 October and grew quickly, with shelters starting to decrease after 11 November as noted. A smaller camp is located 7 km southeast in the village tract of Ka Nyin Tan Alel Than Kyaw Ka Nyin Tan with approximately 200 shelters as of 11 November 2017. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
