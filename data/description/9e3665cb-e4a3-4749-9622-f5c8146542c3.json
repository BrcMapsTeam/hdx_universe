{"notes": "From February to October 2016, the American Red Cross and its local Red Cross partners completed an effort to extensively map areas within a 15-kilometer distance of the shared borders between Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this work was to create an open and comprehensive dataset of communities for West Africa and to ensure that decision makers, humanitarian workers, and community stakeholders are better aware of water, sanitation, health, and community resources before and during the next crisis.\r\n\r\nTo complete this mapping, the American Red Cross launched a mapping center in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea, and used it as both a base of operations and a community engagement facility. Over 100 volunteers helped to complete a rapid assessment of the region, visiting over 7,000 communities by motorbike to complete a vulnerability survey with the village leader. Next, over 100 communities were selected for a round of detailed mapping, focusing on collecting the location and information about every water point, health facility and other community resource in the area. In addition, we led technical skills trainings and mapping events both in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou and across the region. \r\n\r\n**ALL DATA EXCEPT FOR THE OpenStreetMap EXTRACTS ARE LICENSED AS CC-BY 4.0**"}
