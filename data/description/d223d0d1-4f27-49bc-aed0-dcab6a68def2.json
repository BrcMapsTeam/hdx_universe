{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of flood affected land as detected by RADARSAT-2 imagery acquired 08 August 2014 in Khartoum State, Sudan. The area surrounding Khartoum City and Umdurman was inundated by floods caused by heavy rains. Areas to the South of Umdurman seem to have been flooded and many other areas including Umdaba and East Nile seem to suffer from waters and/or muds.  It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
