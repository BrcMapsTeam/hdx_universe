{"notes": "In October, November and December 2016, a comprehensive mixed qualitative verification exercise was undertaken in Afghanistan. A secondary data review of assessment data identifying IDPs displaced between the 1st of January 2014 and 1st of March 2016 allowed an estimate of nationwide prolonged IDP locations and population. Field teams then verified through key informant interviews, data requests and field visits to verify the populations found at each location, and snowballed to widen the geographic coverage. The final dataset presented here is the list of locations verified, with estimated populations. "}
