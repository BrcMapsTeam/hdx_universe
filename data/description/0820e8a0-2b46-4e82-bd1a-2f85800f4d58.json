{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in Ramadi City, Iraq. Using satellite imagery collected 29 January 2016 collected by the GeoEye-1 satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 06 July 2014, UNOSAT analysis has identified 1,165 destroyed structures, 818 severely damaged structures, and 1,222 moderately damaged structures within the downtown area of Ramadi. Considerably more damage is found in surrounding areas of the city (not shown on map). Note that this analysis documents destruction occurring between 6 July 2014 and 29 January 2016, certain areas of Ramadi show destruction occurring prior to 6 July 2014. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
