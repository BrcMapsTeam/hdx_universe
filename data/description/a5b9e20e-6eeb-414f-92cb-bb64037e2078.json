{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters over Northern Rakhine State, Myanmar, in the areas of Kyauktaw, Mrauk-Oo, Ponnagyun & Rathedaung, Pauktaw and Minbya townships, as imaged by the TerraSAR-X satellite on 10 August 2015. In the analyzed area a total of ~60.000 ha of lands are affected by floods, mainly agricultural and/or paddy fields. The surface covered with water in the analyzed area has increased from a pre-flood level of 4% to 8% during the flood period. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas near the main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
