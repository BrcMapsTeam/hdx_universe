{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the city of Idlib, Idlib Governorate, Syria. Using satellite imagery acquired 02 May 2014, 15 September 2013, and 22 March 2010, UNITAR / UNOSAT identified a total of 307 affected structures. Approximately 102 of these were destroyed, 101 severely damaged, and 104 moderately damaged. While much of the city was damaged by 15 September 2013, 115 structures were newly damaged and one structure experienced an increase in damage between that date and 02 May 2014. Due to cloud obstruction in 02 May 2014 imagery, the total number of affected structures may be underestimated. This analysis was done of the REACH initiative for the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
