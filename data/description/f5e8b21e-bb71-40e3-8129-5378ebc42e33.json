{"notes": "This dataset includes an estimate of global drought annual repartition based on Standardized Precipitation Index. It is based on two sources: 1) A global monthly gridded precipitation dataset obtained from the Climatic Research Unit (University of East Anglia). 2) A GIS modeling of global Standardized Precipitation Index based on Brad Lyon (IRI, Columbia University) methodology. This product was designed by UNEP/GRID-Europe for the Project of Risk Evaluation, Vulnerability, Information & Early Warning (PreView). It was modeled using global data.
