{"notes": "This map illustrates the damage assessment in the Lautoka city and greater area in Ba Province in the northwestern part of Viti Levu Island, Fiji, as determined by satellite imagery analysis. Using imagery acquired 22 February 2016, UNITAR-UNOSAT identified a total of 900 damaged structures, of which 433 were within the city limits. In the greater Lautoka area, 74 structures were identified to be destroyed, 152 were severely damaged, and 674 have suffered moderate damages. These damaged structures were compared with total number of buildings/structures (\u00a0~17,500) in the region and the percentage of damaged buildings across the area was estimated to be about 5%. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT.\u00a0\u00a0"}
