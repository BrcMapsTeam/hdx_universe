{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of flood affected land as detected by LANDSAT-8 imagery acquired 10 September 2014 in Wazirabad area, Punjab Province (Pakistan). The area along Chenab River and agricultural areas northern Wazirabad are most likely inundated by floods caused by monsoon rains. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated because of the cloud coverage on the image. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
