{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected surface water extent in the northern part of Guatemala covering Chisec, Coban Ixcan and Sayaxche municipalities, using a Sentinel-1 satellite image acquired on the 09 October 2017. Sentinel-1 imagery acquired on 3 and 5 October 2017 was used as pre crisis imagery. UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis shows an expansion of water of ~ 4,600 has over the analyzed municipalities, being Sayaxche the municipality that was affected the most with an expansion of flood waters of ~ 3,200 Ha. The exact limit of flood waters is uncertain because of the low spatial resolution of the satellite data used for this analysis. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
