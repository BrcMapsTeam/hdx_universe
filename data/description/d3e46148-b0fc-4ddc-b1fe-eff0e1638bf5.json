{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters and other buildings at the Minkaman IDP Site in Lakes State, South Sudan, as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite on 3 July 2014. People displaced by ongoing instability in the region of Bor have established multiple IDP camps on the west bank of the White Nile in Awerial County. Imagery acquired on 10 May 2014 showed approximately 9,391 shelters and 450 infrastructure or support buildings occupying multiple areas along the White Nile. Imagery also showed an area being prepared for accommodating new shelters. As of 3 July 2014 this ground has been partially covered by shelters as well as other areas of the IDP site, and approximately 13,492 shelters and 572 infrastructure or support buildings have been detected. Note that IDPs sheltering under trees are not detected by this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT"}
