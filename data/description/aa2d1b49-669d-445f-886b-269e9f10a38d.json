{"notes": "This map illustrates locations of destroyed structures in the area of Paoua, Central African Republic. Using a satellite image acquired 18 June 2014 and compared to an image from 12 January 2012, UNOSAT reviewed the town of Paoua and surrounding areas to locate obvious signs of destroyed structures (see inset for example). An estimated total of 323 destroyed structures were located in the area as well as 25 possible damage structures, both in Paoua and in outlying towns and villages. The destroyed structures comprise an estimated 2.2% of the total number of pre-conflict structures in Paoua.Most destruction detected in the 18 June image was most likely a result of burning given the blackened structural remains visible in the imagery. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field."}
