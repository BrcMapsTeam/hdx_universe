{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters over Save River in Mozambique as observed from the Radarsat-2 images acquired on 17 February 2017 and 05 February 2017. A decrease of surface waters was observed in the 17 February 2017 image compared to the 05 February 2017 image along the Save river. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field.\u00a0Please send ground feedback to UNITAR UNOSAT."}
