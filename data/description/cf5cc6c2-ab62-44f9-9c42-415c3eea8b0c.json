{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the Caia, Chemba, Mopeia and Mutarara and Morrumbala Districts of Mozambique and Nsanje District of southern Malawi along the Shire River as detected by Landsat-7 imagery acquired 07 February 2015. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
