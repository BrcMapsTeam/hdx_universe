{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of damage in the Al Thama, Al Sabri, Old Benghazi, Al Salmane Al Sharge, and Al Salmane Al Garbe neighborhoods of Benghazi City, Libya. Using satellite imagery acquired 04 and 19 April 2016 as well as 01 August 2015, UNITAR-UNOSAT identified a total of 1,184 potentially damaged structures in these neighborhoods. Approximately 75 of these were destroyed, 198 severely damaged, 426 moderately damaged, and 485 possibly damaged. A slightly higher margin of error is possible in this analysis due to utilization of multiple images and the uncontrolled nature of construction in Benghazi during the analysis timeframe. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
