{"notes": "The Who does What Where (3W) is a core humanitarian coordination dataset. It is critical to know where humanitarian organizations are working, what they are doing and their capability in order to identify gaps, avoid duplication of efforts, and plan for future humanitarian response (if needed). The data includes a list of humanitarian organizations by district and cluster, as well as a unique count of organizations."}
