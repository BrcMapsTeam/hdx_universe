{"notes": "The Nepal Earthquake Severity Index is designed to provide an overview of estimated severity of impacts resulting from the earthquake of 25 April 2015. It is not a replacement for first hand damage and needs assessment information, but can support prioritisation during early stages of the response.\r\n\r\nIt estimates severity based on: 1) the intensity of the earthquake; 2) population; 3) vulnerability of housing and population.\r\n\r\nThis index will be updated to take account of: validation against first hand reports and improvements to the severity model; improved sources of data (quality, timeliness and scale); changing requirements as the response continues. Version 2 is the latest version of the Index.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [Nepal Earthquake Severity Index (Version 4 - 30 April 2015)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x6IXahlOYYypLhlxTsB_X1CA4RVIAPKCMFewRPIvOzY) for more information\r\n"}
