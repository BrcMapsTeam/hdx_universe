{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the Gundy Hamy village of Sinjar District, Nineveh Province, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 18 and 28 November 2015, 30 December 2014, and 07 August 2014, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 34 potentially affected structures. Approximately 15 of these were destroyed, 9 severely damaged, 4 moderately damaged, and 6 possibly damaged. Note that due to less-than-ideal imagery characteristics the error margin for this analysis is likely higher than usual, and due to terrain distortion the spatial accuracy is +/- 15 meters. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
