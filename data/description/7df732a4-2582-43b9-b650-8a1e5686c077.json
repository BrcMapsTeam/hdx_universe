{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of flood as detected by Sentinel-1 imagery acquired on 28 July 2015 near Lahore area in Northern Punjab. It is likely that flood waters have been systematically underestimated along highly vegetated areas along main river banks, and within built-up urban areas because of the special characteristics of the satellite data used. This analysis has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR /UNOSAT."}
