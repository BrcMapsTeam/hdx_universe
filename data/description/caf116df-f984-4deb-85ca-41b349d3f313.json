{"notes": "These datasets  are derived from the boundaries of the Barangays as observed at the end of April 2016 as per the Philippine Geographic Standard Code (PSGC) dataset. It has been generated on the basis of the layer created by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in the context of the 2015 population census.  These layers are up-to-date as of the second quarter of 2016. Acknowledge PSA and NAMRIA as the sources.  LMB is still the source of official administrative boundaries of the Philippines. In the absence of available official administrative boundary, the IMTWG have agreed to clean and use the PSA administrative boundaries which are used to facilitate data collection of surveys and censuses. The dataset can only be considered as indicative boundaries and not official.\r\n* For administrative level 4 (Barangay) please contact the contributor (OCHA Philippines) via this page.\r\nThis COD replaces https://data.humdata.org/dataset/philippines-administrative-boundaries"}
