{"notes": "Between April and June 2014, significant flooding arose in the northern regions of the country \u2013 namely in eight northern provinces. The poor structural integrity of houses, thick muds and a general lack of flood awareness led to large scale damage amongst affected communities. More than 112,000 individuals residing in nearly 17,000 households were impacted. As a result, the humanitarian community mobilized to assist 6,480 fully damaged households and 5,264 partially damaged households. This evaluation intends to provide information on the amount of self-recovery, consisting of the level and type of coping strategies used by both assisted and non-assisted households since the flooding in 2014. Therefore, the evaluation provides Shelter Cluster partners with the information they need to plan for effective and targeted intervention and advocate for further response on behalf of vulnerable households. Data was collected between 7th March and 3rd April 2017 and a probability sampling strategy was used."}
