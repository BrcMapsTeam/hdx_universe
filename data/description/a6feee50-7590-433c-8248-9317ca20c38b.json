{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the city of Fallujah, Al Anbar Province, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 28 and 29 June 2016, UNOSAT identified 491 destroyed structures, 300 severely damaged structures, and 453 moderately damaged structure. This latest analysis, combined with a previous UNOSAT analysis (done using an image from 30 November 2014), indicates a total of 1,422 destroyed structures (an increase of 53% from 2014), 604 severely damaged structures (an increase of 99% from 2014), and 578 moderately damaged structures (an increase of 362% from 2014). The total number of destroyed or damaged structures therefore increased from 1,360 to 3,964, an increase of 191%. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
