{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of IDPs in the UNMISS Malakal base as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite on 18 January 2014. Fleeing outbreaks of violence, a portion of the UNMISS compound was in use by IDPs, occupying more than 8.3 ha. Note that IDP occupied areas include improvised shelters and, in some cases, administrative support and other structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
