{"notes": "Due to the growing prevalence of land disputes in Somaliland, comprehensive knowledge of the local perspectives of land ownership, rights, and conflict is needed for effective programming and policy development. Observatory of Conflict and Violence Prevention has conducted a baseline assessment in order to gain a better understanding of the factors and dynamics of issues surrounding land ownership, land rights and land conflict in Somaliland.\r\nData was collected in December 2013 among 513 residents in Hargeisa, Gabiley, Borama, Salaxley, and Oodweyne districts. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were also conducted within each district. Funding for this project was provided by the Japan Centre for Conflict Prevention (JCCP)."}
