{"notes": "This datasets contains the coverage of automatic Weather  Stations (AWS). Eight AWS are strategically located in the northern parts of the country including Hargeysa, Borama, Aburin, Dacarbudhug, Xumbaweyne, Ceerigaabo, Garowe and Gaalckacyo . The nineth AWS is located in the south at the border of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia in Mandera town. It is hoped that when the situation allows more automatic weather stations will be installed in the southern regions. The stations record a variety of weather elements including; rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction and solar radiation. Data from these automatic stations is received in SWALIM Nairobi office daily in near-real-time through satellite at a frequency of every four hours. The data is then transmitted to the public though a client service platform on the SWALIM website."}
