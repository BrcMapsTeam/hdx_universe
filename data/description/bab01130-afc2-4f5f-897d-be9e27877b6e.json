{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected potentially affected shelters in Nayapara refugee camp in Teknaf Union, Cox s Bazar District, and Chittagong Division of Bangladesh. About 12,500 people are registred in this camp. The UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades satellite image acquired the 05th of June 2017 and could identify 560 possible damaged shelter structures within the extent of the camp. Kindly note that the number of damaged shelters could have been underestimated as some groups of shelter structures might be identified as one structure.This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
