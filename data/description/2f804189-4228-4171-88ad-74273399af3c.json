{"notes": "This dataset contains a list of the countries affected by the El Ni\u00f1o as at April 21, 2016 as reported jointly by FAO, the Global Food Security Cluster and WFP on 21 April 2016 in the [2015-2016 El Ni\u00f1o: WFP and FAO Overview](http://www.foodsecuritycluster.net/document/2015-2016-el-nino-wfp-and-fao-overview) update. According to the World Bank, El Ni\u00f1o is likely to have a negative impact in more isolated local food markets, and many countries are already facing increased food prices. Food Security Cluster partners have implemented preparedness activities and are responding in countries where the effects of El Ni\u00f1o have materialised, such as Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea, Malawi and throughout Central America. In Southern Africa, many areas have seen the driest October-December\r\nperiod since at least 1981, and some 14 million people in the region are already facing hunger, which adds to fears of a spike in the numbers of the food insecure later this year through 2017."}
