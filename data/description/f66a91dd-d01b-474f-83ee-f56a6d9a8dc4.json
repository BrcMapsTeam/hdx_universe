UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades images acquired on 20 and 23 September 2017 as post imagery. Within the extent of this map UNITAR-UNOSAT identified in the cloud free zones about 3723 potentially damaged structures. Taking into account the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, this represents about 70 % of the total number of structures within the analysed cloud free areas. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
