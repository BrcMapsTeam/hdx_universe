{"notes": "This map illustrates the extent of the snow cover caused by the storm \"Huda\" that moved through the Middle East region\u00a0striking Lebanon, Jordan, and the West Bank from about 7-12 January. This analysis was based on satellite imagery collected by the MODIS sensor on the NASA Terra satellite on 12 January 2015. As seen in the imagery the snow has covered a very extensive part of the Lebanon and Syria. Due to cloud cover present on the imagery an extensive portion of the area of interest could not be analysed. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
