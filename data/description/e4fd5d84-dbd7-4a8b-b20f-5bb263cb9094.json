{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected waters over Tonzang  township, Chin Division, Myanmar. UNITAR-UNOSAT analyzed imagery collected by the Pleiades satellite on 16 September 2015 and detected the presence of a landslide over a mountainous area in Tonzang township. As a consequence of the landslide waters have accumulated in the area forming a dam. Imagery shows that a total of 34 hectares are covered by water. The heavy cloud cover in the area prevents UNOSAT from determining the exact dimension of the landslide. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
