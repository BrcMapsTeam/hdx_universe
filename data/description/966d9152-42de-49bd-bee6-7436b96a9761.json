{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of destruction in the town of Leer as seen by the GeoEye-1 satellite on 2 February 2014. UNOSAT analysed all structures in the town to verify reports of damage and determined that a large portion of the town has been destroyed, primarily by fire. A total of 1,556 burned or otherwise destroyed structures (including tukuls, other residential structures, and outbuildings) were identified throughout the town, as well as 26 destroyed commercial structures. Several active structural fires and smoke plumes (see inset) are also visible as of 2 February, as are indications of looting. This is a preliminary analysis & has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
