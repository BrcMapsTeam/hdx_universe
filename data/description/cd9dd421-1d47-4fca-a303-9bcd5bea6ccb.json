{"notes": "With the rainy season in South Sudan coming to an end in September of 2015, the United Nations (UN) Country Team and humanitarian actors required information to plan efficient delivery of assistance and protection to people in need. Due to challenging logistical conditions, it had not been possible to reach this population during the rainy season. The United Nations Institute for Training and Research ? Operational Satellite Applications Program (UNITAR-UNOSAT) developed a monitoring framework for South Sudan, in consultation with United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and other organizations working in the country. To support humanitarian assistance planning, UNITAR-UNOSAT conducted a qualitative analysis using high-resolution satellite imagery over portions of the Unity and Jonglei states in South Sudan (see Map 1). The analysis identified areas of destruction, looting, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and visible cattle, a potentially useful indicator of population and wealth distribution in these areas. Subsequently, UNITAR-UNOSAT performed a quantitative analysis of possible IDP shelters and estimated the number of potentially damaged structures within the same areas. This report outlines the methods and results of this analysis."}
