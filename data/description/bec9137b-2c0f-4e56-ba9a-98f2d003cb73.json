{"notes": "In February 2016, a second round of the MSNA was initiated by REACH, supported by ECHO. This\r\nassessment has a reduced scope compared to the 2015 assessment, with findings drawn from community level\r\ndata, collected from \u201cPeople with Knowledge\u201d (PwK) with particular focus on the situation in East Libya. Findings\r\nindicate that the situation of some population groups remains challenging, with prevalent threats to personal safety\r\nand security reported in certain locations in addition to unaffordable basic needs, weakened WASH infrastructure,\r\nand restricted access to livelihoods and liquidity in some areas.\r\n"}
