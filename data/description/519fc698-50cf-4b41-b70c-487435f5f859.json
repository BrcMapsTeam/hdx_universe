{"notes": "This map illustrates the Doro Refugee Camp in Maban County of Upper Nile State in South Sudan. Using high-resolution optical satellite imagery collected by the WorldView-2 satellite, UNOSAT located a total of 16,042 shelters and 421 non-shelter structures as of 14 December 2013. This is a 12% increase in number of shelters since the previous UNOSAT analysis of Doro camp which used an image from 13 January 2013 and located 14,288 shelters and 202 non-shelter structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
