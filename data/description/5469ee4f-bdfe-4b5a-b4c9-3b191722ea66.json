{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the region of Kayin and Mon State in the areas of Papun, Bilin, Hlaingbwe, Thaton, Pa-An, Paung, Moulmein, Kyaikmaraw, and Kya In Seikkyi townships of Myanmar as imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellite on 6 August 2015. Waters along the Salween River have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the river bank. Total surface covered with water in the analyzed area has increased from a pre-flood level of 4% to 10% during the flood period, and as of 6 August 2015 a total of ~230,000 ha of lands were affected. Most of the affected lands north of Letpan town seem to be mainly agricultural fields, many of which are of course frequently inundated at other times as well. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
