{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected shelters in the area of the Rukban border crossing on the Syrian- Jordanian border. Using a satellite image collected by the Deimos-2 satellite on 24 April 2016, UNOSAT located 6,104 probable shelters in the open desert along and near the Jordanian side of the border about 25 kilometers southwest of the Al Waleed border crossing. This is an 81 percent increase in apparent shelters visible compared to the previous UNOSAT analysis done using an image collected 03 February 2016. Due to the very small size, the irregularity of the shelters and the cloud cover it is likely that some shelters may have been missed in this analysis, or some shelters were included erroneously. In addition, the border in this area is poorly surveyed and in dispute and has thus been depicted as a zone for the purposes of this map. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
