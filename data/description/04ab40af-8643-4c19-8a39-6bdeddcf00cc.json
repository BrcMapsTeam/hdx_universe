{"notes": "This map illustrates the Gendrasa refugee camp in Maban County of Upper Nile State in South Sudan. Using high-resolution optical satellite imagery collected by the WorldView-2 satellite, UNOSAT located a total of 8,028 shelters and 145 non-shelter structures as of 06 December 2013. This is an 80% increase in the number of shelters since the previous UNOSAT analysis of the Gendrasa camp which used an image from 03 October 2012 and located 4,334 shelters and 187 non-shelter structures. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
