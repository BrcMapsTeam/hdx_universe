{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters over north Rakhine State, Myanmar, in the areas of Kyauktaw and Ponnagyun and Rathedaung townships, as imaged by the Radarsat-2 satellite on 17 August 2015. Waters along the Kaladan River have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the river bank. Total surface area covered with water in the analysed area has increased from a pre-flood level of 4% to 8% during the flood period, and as of 17 August 2015 a total of ~55,000 ha of lands were affected.\u00a0Due to sensor limitations, flood waters could be underestimated in urban areas and areas covered with vegetation.\u00a0This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
