{"notes": "This map illustrates the satellite-detected surface waters extent and evolution in north of Quang Binh Province, Vietnam, as observed from the Sentinel-1 images acquired on 12 and 24 October 2016.  Within the analysed area, an increase of surface waters extent was observed from the 24 October 2016 image: ~4,400 ha of surface water were observed the 12 October 2016 and reached ~6,400 ha the 24 October 2016. All over the analysed zone, it corresponds to an evolution of about 45%. As example, in Tien Lang lake and dam an increase of water surface of 77 ha was observed corresponding to an evolution of ~70% by comparison to the water surface detected on 12 October 2016. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
