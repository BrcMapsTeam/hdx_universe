{"notes": "This is an extraction of the WFP global obstacles dataset (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-obstacles) for Haiti showing obstacles after Hurricane Matthew.\r\n\r\nThe dataset will refresh by itself as data is edited on our side, so it means it will always contain the most up-to-date data we have on the Logistics Cluster/WFP side, even though the date on hdx is showing an earlier date.\r\n\r\nSources of information come mainly from Social Media compiled by local Haitian Bloggers: https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/cyclone-matthew-haiti_105242#9/18.8166/-72.5290\r\n\r\nThe dataset is the one used to produce the Logistics Cluster Access Constraints map: http://www.logcluster.org/sector/hurrimat16"}
