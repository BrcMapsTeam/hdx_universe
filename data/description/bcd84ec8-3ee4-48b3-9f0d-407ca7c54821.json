{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected destroyed or otherwise damaged structures in Maungdaw and Buthindaung townships, Maungdaw District, Myanmar. The analysis found a total area of more than 400 thousand square meters of destroyed structures occurring between 16 and 25 September 2017. This represents an increase of approximately 2% since last UNOSAT analysis with imagery collected on 16 September, when more than 20 square kilometers of destroyed structures were identified. Additionally, 122 fires were detected within the area between 16 and 25 September 2017 by the MODIS and VIIRS sensors, with recent fire detections indicating destruction is likely ongoing. Most of the detected fires are located in the proximity of the affected areas as observed in the imagery collected 25 September. Finally, heavy cloud cover during the period in question, and on 16 and 25 September especially, indicates that destruction and fire detections are likely underestimated in this analysis. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
