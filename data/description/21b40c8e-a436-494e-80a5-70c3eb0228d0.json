{"notes": "Product\r\n=============\r\nThis priority index was derived by combining a detailed flood extent mapping with detailed human settlement geo-data. Both sources were combined to produce the location and magnitude of population living in flooded areas. This was subsequently aggregated to admin-4 areas (GND) as well as admin-3 areas (DS divisional). \r\n\r\nThe flood extent mapping was derived in turn by combining two sources: Flood extent maps could be produced rather faster using satellite imageries captured by either optical sensors or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In most places flood is cause by heavy rainfall which means in most cases cloud is present, this is a limitation for optical sensors as they can\u2019t penetrate clouds. Radar sensors are not affected by cloud, which make them more useful in presence of cloud. In This analysis we analyzed sentinel2 optical image from May 28th and Sentinel 1 SAR image from May 30th.  Then we combine the two results adding up the flood extents.\r\n\r\nMain cloud covered areas and permanent water bodies are removed from the flood extent map using the Sentinel 2 cloud mask. The scale/resolution of the flood extent map is 30mts where as the permanent water body map has 250m scale resolution. This will introduce some discrepancy: part of flood extent  map could be permanent water body. \r\n\r\nScope\r\n=============\r\nAnalysis focused on 4 districts in South-West Sri Lanka based on news reports (https://www.dropbox.com/s/n0qdqe7qfgq6fyv/special_situation.pdf?dl=0). Based on the admin-3-level analysis, highest percentages of population living in flooded areas were seen in Matara district. Admin-4 level analysis concentrated only on Matara district for that reason.\r\n\r\nCaveats\r\n=============\r\nThe dataset is showing percentage flooded. The data has not yet been corrected for small populations. We believe the product is currently pointing to the high priority areas. In the shp or csv files the user of this data could easily correct for small populations, if there is a wish to target on the amount of people affected.\r\n\r\nData used from partners\r\n=============\r\nThe human settlement data was retrieved from http://ciesin.columbia.edu/data/hrsl/. Facebook Connectivity Lab and Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN - Columbia University. 2016. High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL). Source imagery for HRSL \u00a9 2016 DigitalGlobe. Accessed 01-06-2017.\r\n\r\nThe Radar imagery analysis was done by NASA JPL, whose input in this product has been crucial.\r\n \r\nVisualization\r\n===========\r\nAn example map is available here:\r\nhttp://bit.ly/SriLankaFloodMap\r\n\r\nLinked data\r\n==========\r\nAdmin boundaries 3 and 4 can be found here (link on OBJECT_ID): https://data.humdata.org/group/lka?q=&ext_page_size=25&sort=score+desc%2C+metadata_modified+desc&tags=administrative+boundaries#dataset-filter-start\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n=============\r\nThe ratio column in the SHPs or CSVs can be multiplied by 100 to get the percentage of flooding in the area."}
