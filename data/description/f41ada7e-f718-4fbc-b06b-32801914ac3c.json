{"notes": "The number of families enduring long periods of displacement in Afghanistan is increasing. Although it has often been presumed that those displaced for long periods eventually adapt to their surroundings and integrate into their host community, this assessment report shows that this is not the case. Isolated from their social networks, internally displaced persons (IDPs) displaced over a long period of time struggle to secure regular employment, adequate shelter and are often food insecure. This prolonged IDP (PIDP) assessment report is designed to identify the needs and vulnerabilities of those displaced for prolonged periods of time, beyond the initial emergency displacement period."}
