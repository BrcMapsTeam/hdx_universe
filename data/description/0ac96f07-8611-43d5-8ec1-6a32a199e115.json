{"notes": "This map illustrates potentially damaged structures and buildings in Portsmouth\u00a0\u00a0(Saint John Parish) as detected by satellite image acquired after landfall of the Tropical Cyclone Maria-17 on 19 September 2017. UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades image acquired on 20 September 2017 as post imagery. UNITAR-UNOSAT identified in the analysed area (Portsmouth and surroundings) 782 potentially damaged structures. Taking into account the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, this represents 55% of the total number of structures within the cloud free analysed area. The analysis could have been underestimated due to cloud cover. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field.\u00a0Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT. "}
