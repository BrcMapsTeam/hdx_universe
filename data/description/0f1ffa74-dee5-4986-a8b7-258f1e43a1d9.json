{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the northeastern portion of the Gaza Strip, including areas of Gaza City, Toffah, Shija'ia, and Shaaf, resulting from ongoing violence in the area. Using a satellite image collected 25 July 2014 by the Pleiades satellite, and compared with a pre-crisis Pleiades image collected 6 July 2014, UNOSAT analysis has identified 700 destroyed structures, 316 severely damaged structures, and 102 moderately damaged structures. In addition, 404 craters on roads and in agricultural and non-urbanized areas are also visible as of 25 July 2014. Further analysis will be done as additional imagery is collected. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR/UNOSAT."}
