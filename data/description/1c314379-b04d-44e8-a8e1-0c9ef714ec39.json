{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of IDPs in the UNMISS Malakal base as seen by the WorldView-2 satellite on 26 September 2015.  Imagery acquired on this date  shows that the IDP camp extent has increased compared with the previous UNOSAT analysis. Imagery also shows that shelters installed outside the UNMISS base are still increasing. Note that IDP occupied areas include improvised shelters and, in some cases, administrative support and other structures which gives a total number of 536 Camp infrastructure buildings and 7,791 Shelter structures. As can be seen from the imagery, PoC 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the initial or old Protection of Civilians (PoC) zones, Sector 1 and 2 are the new PoC extensions while Sector 3 is a contingency area mainly for administrative structures and Sector 4 is void of any infrastructure at the moment.  This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
