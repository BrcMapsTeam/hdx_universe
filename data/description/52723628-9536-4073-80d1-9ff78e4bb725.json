{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage in Old City, Mosul, Ninawa Governorate, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 30 June 2017, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 5,536 affected structures within this part of city. This marks an overall increase of 37% in damage affected structures from the assessment fourteen days prior on 16 June. Approximately 490 of these were destroyed (9% of the total affected buildings), 3,310 severely damaged (60% of the total affected buildings) and 1,736 moderately damaged (31% of the total affected buildings). This marks a 150% increase in destroyed buildings, 0% in moderately damaged buildings and 57% severely damaged buildings from the 16 June assessment.  The most heavily impacted area appears to be the Ammu Baqqal neighbourhood (see inset). Due to the densely constructed nature of this part of the city, these values might be underestimated. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
