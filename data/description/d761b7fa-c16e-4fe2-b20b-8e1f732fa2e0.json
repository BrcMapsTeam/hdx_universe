{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected flood waters in the central part of Sagaing region in the areas of Shwebo, Wetlet and Khin-U townships of Myanmar as imaged by the Sentinel-1 satellite on 11 August 2015. Waters along the Mu River have expanded and inundated lands on either sides of the river bank. Floods affected lands increased on the left bank of the Mu River (downstream). Total surface area covered with water in the analysed area has increased from a pre-flood level of 1% to 7% during the flood period, and as of 11 August 2015 a total of ~250,000 ha of lands were affected. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
