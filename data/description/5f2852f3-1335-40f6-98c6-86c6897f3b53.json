{"notes": "EbolaGeonode was a partnership platform for sharing geospatial data, analysis and maps related to the Ebola emergency response. The platform was intended to minimize the time that GIS analysts spend locating up-to-date data. Users were able to make maps on the fly, view metadata, and access the reports behind GIS layers. Curators worked to ensure that the layers were recent, clean, useful, and legally and technically open."}
