{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage in Old City, Mosul, Ninawa Governorate, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 16 June 2017, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 4,040 affected structures within this part of city. This marks an overall increase of 56% in damage affected structures from the assessment five days prior on 11 June. Approximately 196 of these were destroyed (5% of the total affected buildings), 2,107 severely damaged (52% of the total affected buildings) and 1,737 moderately damaged (43% of the total affected buildings). This marks a 28% increase in destroyed buildings, 17% in moderately damaged buildings and 121% severely damaged buildings from the 11 June assessment.  The most heavily impacted area appears to be the Bab al-Tub neighbourhood (see inset). Due to the densely constructed nature of this part of the city, these values might be underestimated. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
