{"notes": "This map illustrates potentially damaged structures and buildings in the north-western part of Dominica (St. Andrew, St. Joseph & St. David Parishes) as detected by satellite image acquired after landfall of the Tropical Cyclone Maria-17 on 19 September 2017. UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades image acquired on 23 September 2017 and a WorldView-3 image acquired on 1 October 2017 as post imagery. Within the extent of the analyzed areas, UNITAR-UNOSAT identified in the cloud free zones 5,609 potentially damaged structures. Taking into account the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, this represents about 90 % of the total number of structures within the analysed cloud free areas. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
