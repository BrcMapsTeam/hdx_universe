{"notes": "* These datasets are intended for coordination and operations in humanitarian activities.\t\r\n* The purpose of this settlements list in particular is as a gazetteer for geographical reference. It is not intended as a cartographic source or as an authoritative reference list.\t\r\n* The list is derived from IOM's placename database, which is the most extensive currently maintained placename source available for Iraq, and provides compatability with IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).\t\r\n* The list does NOT contain any designations of hierarchy (e.g. governorate / district capitals) or of size (e.g. settlement size or population size). Thus, the placenames refer to a variety of populated places including cities, towns, villages and neighbourhoods.\t\r\n* Arabic names are in the process of being added; some are included in this dataset.\t"}
