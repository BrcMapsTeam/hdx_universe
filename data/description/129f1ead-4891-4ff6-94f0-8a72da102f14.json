{"notes": "This map illustrates potentially damaged structures and buildings in Pointe Michel (Saint Luke Parish) as detected by satellite image acquired after landfall of the Tropical Cyclone Maria-17 on 19 September 2017. UNITAR-UNOSAT analysis used a Pleiades image acquired on 23 September 2017 as post imagery. UNITAR-UNOSAT identified in the analysed area Pointe Michel (St. Luke Parish) 550 potentially damaged structures. Taking into account the pre-building footprints provided by Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, this represent about 70 % of the total number of structures within the analysed area. Evidences of floods and mudflow could be also observed along the two rivers that cross the town of Pointe Michel. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR-UNOSAT."}
