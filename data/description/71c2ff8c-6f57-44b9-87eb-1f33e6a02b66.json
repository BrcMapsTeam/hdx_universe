{"notes": "This map illustrates locations of destroyed structures in the area of Marcounda Sub-Prefecture in the Central African Republic. Using satellite images acquired 21 June, 23 June & 7 July 2014, UNOSAT reviewed almost 4,500 square kilometers of Marcounda to locate signs of destroyed structures. An estimated 3,840 damaged structures are visible across 50 distinct locations in the sub-prefecture. Destruction in many cases was likely due to arson based on appearance of structural remains. In addition, it appears violence and destruction continued between 21 June and 7 July, and heavy rains apparently caused significant damage to structures as well. Overall, UNOSAT estimates that approximately 40% of structures in Marcounda Sub-Prefecture have been completely destroyed and many others are likely damaged to some degree. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
