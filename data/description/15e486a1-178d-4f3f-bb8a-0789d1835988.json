{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected damage and destruction in the Sinjar area of Nineveh Province, Iraq. Using satellite imagery acquired 18 and 28 November 2015, 30 December 2014, and 07 August 2014, UNITAR - UNOSAT identified a total of 1,780 potentially affected structures. Approximately 544 of these were destroyed, 473 severely damaged, 457 moderately damaged, and 306 possibly damaged. Note that due to less-than-ideal imagery characteristics the error margin for this analysis is likely higher than usual, and due to terrain distortion the spatial accuracy is +/- 15 meters. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
