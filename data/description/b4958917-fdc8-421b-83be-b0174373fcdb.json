{"notes": "This is a simplified ( generalized or smoothed) version of the detailed Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB) dataset. The included simplified boundary lines are rarely shifted by more than 100 meters from the detailed LSIB lines. The included lines match the simplified LSIB polygons: (1) Africa & Americas and (2) Eurasia & Oceania.\r\n\r\nThe simplified boundary lines reflect all current US government policies on boundaries, boundary disputes, and sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThere are no restrictions on use of this public domain data. This dataset will be updated as needed and is current as of March 30, 2017."}
