{"notes": "This map illustrates the camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the UNMISS base at Juba airport as seen by the WorldView-1, Pleiades and WorldView-2 satellites on 30 January, 19 January, 7 January 2014 and 28 December 2013. As of 28 December 2013 a significant portion of the airport was used by IDP?s shelters, occupying approximately 7 ha. Imagery acquired on 30 January 2014 shows that the total area of IDP?s occupies about 9 ha, compared to the 7.9 ha detected on 7 January 2014. Note that IDP occupied areas include improvised shelters and, in some cases, administrative support and other structures. Analysis indicates the extent of the IDP camp on 30 January is largely unchanged from the previous analysis done using an image from 19 January 2014. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR / UNOSAT."}
