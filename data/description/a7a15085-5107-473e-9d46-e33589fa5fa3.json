{"notes": "Buildings in Gaza (on-going digitization)\r\n\r\nFor coordinating future interventions and humanitarian assistances, the Middle East & Near Africa Shelter Cluster in partnership with Terre des Hommes, launched the digitalization of Gaza buildings, in close relation with [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about) contributors, based on an imagery of the July 6, 2014. The results will be essential to fine tune existing UNOSAT damage assessment and to provide to the humanitarian community a precise baseline for analysis related to destruction and population displaced.
