{"notes": "This map illustrates satellite-detected areas of displaced person settlements in the Daraa and Quneitra Governorates, Syria. Using satellite imagery collected between 3 November 2016 and 7 June 2017, covering an analyzed area of 2,513 sq km (251,362 ha), UNOSAT identified 766 locations where possible displaced persons shelters are visible. Approximately a total of 5,516 shelter structures are estimated to be within the 777 ha of settlement areas. Due to the characteristics of the possible IDP settlements in the area, being the majority of them scattered structures in agricultural fields, the number of possible IDP shelters might have been overestimated. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT."}
